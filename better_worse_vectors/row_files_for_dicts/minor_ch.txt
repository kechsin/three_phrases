Up. Get up.  Now!
Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!
Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything. I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.
Aren’t they wonderful, darling?
Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, pumpkin? This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.
AHH!
My darling boy! How did you get in there?! How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley! It's all right. It's all right.
Awww, smile.  Vernon, just look at him. I can't believe it. In just a week you'll be off to Smeltings.
What, you? Go to Smeltings? Oh, don't be so stupid, you're going to the state school where you belong.  And this is what you're gonna be wearing when I've finished dyeing it.
It'll fit you well enough. Go get the post.  Go!
Have a lovely day at the office, dear. Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up. And we got landed with you.
We had to tell him something.
He's in there. Vernon… Not now, Bopkins. For when the Masons arrive.
…in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home.
Oh! Aaah!
Harry! Harry! Harry, open the door! Marge! How lovely to see...
Nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed. Oh, Vernon!
What happened, Duddikins?
They didn't--? I've lived in this house twenty years.  And now -- in a single night -- I'm expected to leave.
You think I don't know that?  You think I don't know what they're capable of?
You didn't just lose a mother that night in Godric's Hollow, you know.  I lost a sister. What a cruel thing to ask.
Lily! Come out of there! Now!
We're going home. Thanks. Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.
F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.
An iguana s-such as this is... ... an essential in-gredient.
Oh. Y-yes, of course.  And the vampire b-bat...
TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!!  Thought you ought to know. Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh.  Ahh! Hehe....
Severus...I-I thought...
W-what do you m-mean? Yes. He does seem the type, doesn’t he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you.  And trust me, if Snape’s cloak hadn’t caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little countercurse.
I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween. Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn’t fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again.  He rarely left me alone. But he doesn’t understand. I’m never alone, never.  Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?
Come here, Potter. Now!  Tell me... what do you see?  What is it?  What do you see?
Tell the truth! What do you see?! Master, you are not strong enough.
Ahh! Ahh!  What is this magic? Vault 687. Lamp, please.  Key please.
Vault 713.
Stand back. I don't know.
When I was last in your vault, the sword was there. Oh, well then, perhaps it just walked out on its own then.
There is no place safer than Gringotts. Alive.
And brought me here.
You are a very unusual wizard. Soon the Death Eaters will control it. That was unacceptable to me.
This is a wizard's war. I take no side.
It is impossible. How did you come by this sword?
It's complicated.
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault identical to this one, but it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer. The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.
It was not my place to ask, nor did I desire to. There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts.
Perhaps. I have no interest in gold.
That is my price.
I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the Sword of Gryffindor if I help you? Good morning? Good morning? You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewy-eyed schoolgirl!
She gives us away and we might as well use that sword to slit our own throats. Understand?
They know! They know she's an imposter! They've been warned!
I should have known --
The Thief's Downfall. Washes away all enchantments. Can be deadly. No.
We need him!
Well done. Go on.
We'll only have a few seconds. In other words... they'll be no do-
Ready, Bogrod? We'll be crushed! Hurry!
I said I'd get you in. I never said anything about getting you out.
Thieves! Help! Thieves! I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands.  Ah. Here we are.  Well, give it a wave.  Apparently not.  Perhaps this.  No, no, definitely not! No matter...  I wonder.  Curious, very curious.
I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar.
Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great. No!  No!  I believed a different wand would work, I swear!
But it makes no sense...
No!  There must be a way!  I'll think of something else! There's no way out of here. We've tried everything. It's enchanted.
Forgive me if I don't get up.
Anything, m'boy, anything. Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange.
Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has changed. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.
There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist --
He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There's no guarantee he will find it -- He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true, what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance. It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course.
Come on. Platform 9¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first.
Fred, you next. Oh, I'm sorry, George.
How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.  Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you dear. Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could have died! You could have been seen! Of course, I don't blame you, Harry dear. Well, you'd best hope that I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are Harry. Now tuck in! That's it. There we go.
Yes dear. It was on the cat.
Morning Arthur! This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
Arthur!
Well, that'll be Errol with the post. Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please? Oh, no.
We'll manage. There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley.
Right. Here we are Harry, you go first dear. Oh, well you go first Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes. In you go… That's it.
You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That's it, mind your head. That's right. Now take your Floo powder. That's it, very good. Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly.
What did he say, dear? I thought he did.
Oh, Harry! Thank goodness! We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far…
Ah! Here he is! Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That's it, Ron.
The train will be leaving any moment!
Okay. Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry!
Harry.
Good to see you, dear. You got everything you need?
Yes? All of your books?
All of your clothes? Good boy.
Quick. Quick. Ron, Ron! Oh, for goodness' sake! Don't lose him!
Hello, Harry dear. Sirius, the meeting is about to start!
Harry, dear, go on upstairs-— quietly, if you please. They're all up there.
You can come down now, the meeting's over. Arthur-
And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young--
It's not your decision! He's not an adult either!
I only have Harry's best interests at heart.
Who else does he have, then? Morning, dear! Did you have a good sleep?
Good luck, Harry!
You're worse than Fred and George. Harry who?
I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?
I seriously doubt that. But why didn't you tell us you were coming?
That man.  But then, what would we do without him?  Ron!
Eat up, eat up, everyone!  There's more to come! You're sure you won't stay?
Remus...?
Harry!  Hagrid!  What happened?! Have you seen the others? Well, thank goodness you two are all right.
My boy!  My darling boy!  What've they done to you?!
Back off, boys! She's mine!  You will never touch my chiidren again! Good luck.
Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
Leave him alone. Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didn't mean to! Riddle made me, and… Harry, you're hurt!
The Fat Lady! She's gone!
Think you're in love Ron? I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.
Someone here does. Everyone looks at her. She is staring directly at Harry.
And you fought off those dementors that attacked you this summer. I think it should be Dumbledore's Army. There is excited agreement. Harry smiles at her.
We heard Harry yelling. What's up?
Anything we can do to help? We can do that! Me and Luna'll guard the hallway.
What now, Harry?
The Ministry closed a half-hour ago. I expect they all went home. Now where?
I think my ankle's broken. And somebody hit Ron with a weird spell...
Hedwig...?  Mum! Exactly.  How'd you guess?
I'm joking, Mum.
Now you're joking.  I was only wondering when Harry got here. Harry Dimpleton.  Harry Potter, of course.
Well his trunk's in the kitchen. And his owl.
Me, nosy.  Is he up there with you? Harry's.  Haven't seen him, have you?  Apparently, he's wandering about the house.
Meaning?
None of your business. Please.  What's a Wrackspurt?
He's covered in blood again.  Why is it he's always covered in blood?
Shut It! Piss off, Cormac.  How 'bout I toss you a floater?
Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
That's what it says.  Right here. 'This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.' Sorry, I'm not ordinarily late --
What's gotten into him?
Open up, you. Don't trust me?
'Course 'tis.  Made them myself.
Everyone gone to bed? I don't sleep these days.  So I wash my hair.  Silly, right?
Happy Christmas, Harry.
Oh my god... No, Harry!  It's a trap!
'Bout time, don't you think?
You have to get rid of it.  Today. Take my hand.
Over the years, if someone had a secret, if they wanted to conceal something, this is where they came.  Some of these things are almost as old as the castle itself.
Fred and George.  First year.  I hid Tom Riddle's diary here for a time.  Wish I'd left it... What was that?
See, you never know what you'll find up here.
All right.  Close your eyes.  That way you can't be tempted. There's something else.  Another secret of sorts.  One of mine...
That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.
Ron and Tonks should've already been back.  Dad and Fred as well. Oh my God!  George!
Remus!  What're you doing!
Were you going to tell me? And Ron and Hermione.  They'll not be going back to Hogwarts either?
I see.
Zip me up, will you. Seems silly, doesn't it?  A wedding.  Given everything that's going on.
Harry.
Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade. Ready!?
What?
Mad. The both of you. I know.
It's all right. We're going to get you inside.
Don't worry. I won't leave you. I promise. Who's that?
... Hagrid's carrying?
Neville, who is that? No... NO! Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!
SLYTHERIN!
Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff! Ha! Another Weasley. I know just what to do with you... Gryffindor!!
Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It’s all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness! There's no doubt about that. No? Well, if you're sure... better be... GRYFFINDOR!!
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?
Yes, you were particularly difficult to place. But, I stand by what I said last year-- you would have done well in Slytherin. Umm…
Don't despair, Longbottom. I put you in Gryffindor for good reason... I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum.  Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...
Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall! Wingard Levosa.
Yay!
I'll do the counter-curse! I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back!
Neville!
No, ma'am, he's just fainted. Look, everyone! Weasley's got himself a Howler!
Cornish pixies?
Ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha… Fortuna Major. Here, listen. She just won't let me in. Fortuna Major.
She's still doing that after three years. She can't even sing. Exactly. Hey, man. Hey, man. Oh, God. That's awful.
Ron, catch. I think we have a winner.
He's been sighted! He's been sighted!
Sirius Black! Dementors? He's already slipped past them once. Who's to say he won't do it again?
Can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course.
Yeah, let's see. What's that he's drinking do you suppose?
Aw no way, the old codger can see out the back of his head.
Go on Harry, what's the clue? What's the matter with him?
Me mam didn't want me to come back to Hogwarts...
Well...because of you... She...well, she figure's you're, well...you're lying about You-Know- Who and Dumbledore's a right nutter...
Counting on you, Ron.  I've two Galleons on Gryffindor.
Blimey. That's nothing to go on.
Got loads of those, though, doesn't she? There's only one Harry.
I can bring 'er down. That's it. I want a charge on each and every joist.
Woah! Easy up there!
He's good... He's good... Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.
Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrell’s job for years.
Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer? Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep up. Thank you.
This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change.
Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. Caput Draconis.  Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on.
Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boy's dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.
Gryffindors, keep up please. And stay alert! Errol…
Oh look, it's our Hogwarts letters. And they've sent us Harry's as well.
Hello, Sir Nicholas! Excuse me.
I happen to be a school prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at this time of night. What are your names again?
Mind your attitude, Malfoy. Let me through, please. Excuse me! I'm Head Boy! Get back, all of you. No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours. Back to your common room. Be quiet.
The headmaster's here. You heard. Move!
Mind where you're going! Slow down! You listen! I'm Head Boy! Come back here!
Minister, I saw him! You-Know-Who! He was right there! Oh, yes... of course. Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.
Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied.
I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind. Like this.
Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew he'd do well.
Hello, Percy. Miss Clearwater. Thank you!
Good evening!
Thank you! Hello! Hermione! Welcome back! Hello, Harry.
I--Well, Madam Pomfrey asked me to tell you that Hermione and Ron are out of the hospital wing.
I've been expecting this... A lot of people come to me when they've lost loved ones.
He's not coming back, Harry.
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more Whoo-hoo-hoo! Password?
No, no, no. Wait, wait. Watch this. Oh, amazing! Just with my voice.
Yes, all right. Go in. Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name. It's him, headmaster. The one they all talk about. He's here, somewhere in the castle! Sirius Black! Good afternoon, class.
Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon.  Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, up!
With feeling! Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end.  When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...
Mr. Longbottom.
M-M-Mr. Longbottom! Mr. Longbottom! Mr. Longbottom!
Come back down this instant!
Mr. Longbottom-! Everyone out of the way!  Come on, get up.
Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get.  Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch.
Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. Gryffindor win!
Impedimenta!
Don't make me stupify you, Potter! Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker. That's you. There are three kinds of balls.  This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops.  The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops.  With me so far?
You better take this.  Careful now, it's comin' back.  Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater... Uh-oh.
Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you are the seeker, and the only thing I want you to worry about is this... the Golden Snitch. Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.
You catch it... before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.
Scared, Harry? That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.
Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.
I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We are gonna train earlier, harder, and longer. What- I don't believe it! Where do you think you're goin', Flint? I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
“I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker.” You've got a new Seeker. Who?
Watch yourself, Harry! Alright, listen up. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a
Well, that too. Professor McGonagall.
We can't cancel Quidditch. I'll take him from here. One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers?  Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone.
Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then.
Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid! Well done, dear.
Whooaaa! Ooh.
The third floor's clear too, sir. You idiot!
About time!  I've been looking all over for you two.  Names.
No exceptions, Potter. Aurors. For security.
Emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace.
You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely. Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!
The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.
The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game. The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!
Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor!
Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint. Another 10 points to Gryffindor!
He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!
Yeah! We won!! Another goal for Slytherin! They lead Gryffindor ninety to thirty!
Harry Potter has caught the Snitch! Gryffindor wins!
Blimey, Harry... ...and Slytherin is up forty to ten. Alica with the quaffle! Give me that!
Take that side!
Quidditch practice. Easy, Wood. I've got a note.
A gift from Draco's father.
Yeah! Yeah! Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.
A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.
Can you think of no one? Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck. Now, now Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter… Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is legend, as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.
Hmm. You must be very brave, to mention his name…or very foolish.
And you must be… Miss Granger. Yes, Draco's told me all about you, and your parents. Muggles, aren't they? Let me see…red hair… vacant expressions… tatty second hand book. You must be the Weasleys. Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they're paying you overtime, but judging by the state of this, I'd say not. What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it.
Clearly. Associating with Muggles… and I thought your family could sink no lower. I'll see you at work. Already here, Fudge? Good…
Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your-- you call this a house? Huh! No. I simply called at the school, and was told the headmaster was here.
The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. You'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school. You think so?
Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!
I'll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, it's true-- you have returned! Ridiculous!
How dare you?!
My sole concern has always been, and will always be, the welfare of this school and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume? And? Who was it?
Ah!
I see. Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.
Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. We're leaving.
Mine? I don't know what you're talking about. You do, do you? Why don't you prove it? Come, Dobby. Dobby!
Dobby?
What? I didn't give. You've lost me my servant!
Advada.
Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words, Potter, one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end! Well put it this way, if it rains... you'll be the first to know
Don't boast Draco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy yourself won't you. While you can.
My lord. Had I detected any sign or even a whisper of your whereabouts. I assure you I never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence, that was my true mask.
Well, well, if it isn't Patronus Potter.
Come now, Potter, I really don't think that private matters between the Minister and myself are any concern of yours. Shall we continue this in your
I warned you before that one day you would come to a sticky end, Potter.
We don't have him, if that's what you mean. Harry is stunned. The Dark Lord knows your weakness for heroics, Potter. All it took was a little nudge to get you here.
Now give me that prophesy.
That prophesy. Now hand it over or we'll have to use wands on you. Very brave of you, Potter. Or are you foolish?
Really, Potter. You expect to defeat all of us with your little school friends? Now hand it over, and they won't have to die here.
No! If the prophesy is smashed-- You dare to speak the Dark Lord's name?
Control yourself, Bellatrix!
You mean Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden here? So that's what took you so long. We wondered.
Only a person for whom the prophesy was made can remove it from its self, Potter, and the Dark Lord certainly couldn't get it himself.
Stop them! Your race is run, Potter. Hand it over.
You are not in a position to negotiate.
Potter! We may have lost the prophesy, but I can still deliver you to the Dark Lord!
Stupify!
My lord? Yes, my lord.
Dragon -- dragon heartstring.
No, my lord. Draco. Look closely, son. If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord... ...everything would be forgiven. All would be as it was, you understand?
You dare to talk to me like that in my own house?
Forgive me, my Lord, but wouldn't it be more prudent to call off this battle and seek the boy yourself? Of c-course, my Lord.
Draco...
Draco, don't be stupid -- Oy! What do you two think you're doing? Morning, everyone! Good morning, everyone!
Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Now, gather around, everyone. Today, we are going to repot Mandrakes. Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger.
Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor! Now, as our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won't kill you yet. But they could knock you out for several hours, which is why I have given each of you a pair of earmuffs for auditory protection. So, could you please put them on, right away? Quickly! Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly, you pull it sharply up out of the pot… Got it? And… now you dunk it down into the other pot and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
Uh, Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs.
Yes, well, just leave him there. Right! On we go! Plenty of pots to go around. Grasp your Mandrake, and pull it up! That doesn't mean we can't hold him up. Hi, Harry!  I'm Colin Creevy! I'm in Gryffindor, too!
Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry? Ron? Is that your owl?
That's a boggart, that is.
I don't know I can't see him. So why didn't your mum want you to come back to Hogwarts, Seamus?
Ginny!  Let's go!
Where is it? Yes, sir. Come, come, come to me. Come to me!
Blood. I smell blood. Let me rip you. Let me kill you. Kill! Kill!
It's time. Kill. Kill… Time to kill!
Blood…I want blood…They all must die. Kill… Kill… Kill! Time to kill. Oh!
Oh, Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss, you can go. Out of my way. Out of my way! Should've been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat- but growing them back…
Oh, I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business. Well, what do you expect? Pumpkin juice?
Put him here. What happened?
Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
It's good right? Ah… Cool!
Ummm…um. What?
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
Malfoy, are you okay? Let's go. Quick. Run. What are you playing at?
You mean Dumbledore believes him. Ummm…um.
C'mon, Draco. Don't be a prat.
Avada Kedavra! Hello Harry Potter, my name is Tom Riddle.
Yes.
No. But I can show you. Let me take you back fifty years ago… Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come-- three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. The Ministry's got to act.
Albus look, Hagrid's record is against him. I've got to take him.
I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid. Come, Hagrid… Well?
Good boy.
: Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter. He arrived here just five minutes before yourself. As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter... that earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located... a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately. She has been properly punctured and her memory modified. She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever. So that's that... and no harm done.
Yes?
Understand? Come now, Harry the Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban... for blowing up their aunts. On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things... was very, very irresponsible.
We have a killer on the loose.
Nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what matters. And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts. These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty... of having them brought here. Now Tom will show you to your room. Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't... wander.
Professor McGonagall!
Oh, Hagrid... Rosmerta, my dear. I hope business is good.
We have... We have a killer on the loose!
Harry Potter. Come.
Not only did Black lead You-Know-Who to the Potters that night, but he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew!
Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him! A finger. That's all that was left. A finger. Nothing else. And now he wants to finish what he started.
Ah, that's not the worst of it.
Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him! Very interesting.
On the slope.
Good evening. No, Hagrid, thank you. Now gentlemen...
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we? Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff known as Buckbeak, hereinafter called the condemned, shall be executed this day at sundown.
The execution shall dispatch... Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...
Your name only.
Where? What am I supposed to see?
Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
I see no strawberries. Where?
Let's get this over, please.
But where is it? I saw the beast, just now. Not a moment ago! Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him.
Hagrid?
Right. Well, well. We must search the grounds. I will not. In times like these the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength Dumbledore.
The tri-wizard tournament will not be cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward.
What did you say? What did you say to me? Harry! Harry how good to see you again.
Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body must be moved Dumbledore, there are... too many people.
You're late. No matter, the accused will take his seat.
Very well, we are ready to begin.
Ah...you...er...got our message that the time had changed, did you? Well. The...ah...charges.
The charges against the accused shall now be read into the record: That the accused did with deliberation and fore-knowledge of the illegality of his actions, produce a patronus charm in full sight of a Muggle.
Within full sight of a Muggle? It doesn't matter how impressive it was!
Ah, yes, yes, another cock-and-bull story.
Oh, come now, Susan. He's clearly lying. We haven't got time to-
Very well. Weasley, fetch the witness.
Full name? So...what is your story?
Very well, you may go.
Not very convincing. So two Dementors just happen to be in Little Whinging? I think not...
Yes, and they're nothing but bilge, Dumbledore.
Dementors are irrelevant! Well, yes, if he's telling the truth!
Very well, all for clearing the accused of charges?
All opposed? Certainly.
Well, what about the meeting tonight?
So, Dumbledore, you've been behind this whole thing. This has all been your doing! You've been recruiting students for your army!
I knew it! I KNEW it! You've been plotting against me all this time!
This is too good to be true! Yes, shut up, Potter. So, you'll be coming with us to the Ministry--
I see no snag, Dumbledore.
Resisting arrest, now are you, Dumbledore? You would really take on two Aurors, Dolores, and myself, Dumbledore?
Find him!
I know...I saw him too... Seize him!
Dumbledore, what the blazes happened here?
What's he doing here? And what's happened to him? Dumbledore, I want some answers! Who is it?
Hagrid? Is that you?
Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before. That's a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
No! The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler.
We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here.
Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid. Oh, you're still here, are you?
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way. Damn good of my brother to keep you. He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep. Is that my Dudders? Is that my little neffy-pooh? Give us a kiss! Come on! Up, up!
Finish that off for Mommy. Good boy, Rippy-pooh. Just a small one. Excellent nosh, Petunia. A bit more. Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs. Just a bit more. That's a boy! Mm! You wanna try a little drop of brandy? A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh? What are you smirking at? Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby... wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it. You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out. It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out. What is it the boy's father did, Petunia? And a drunk too, no doubt?
What did you say?
Oh, don't worry Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip. Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up. Actually, it's nothing to do with the father. It's all to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the pup.
Mm. Right! Let me tell you... y-y-- Vernon! Vernon! Vernon, do something!
Don't you dare! Welcome to the Knight Bus... emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening. What you doing down there?
What you fall over for?
Well, come on, then. Let's not wait for the grass to grow. What you looking at? Well, come on, then. In. No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in. Come on. Come on. Move on, move on, move on.
Take her away, Ern.
What did you say your name was again? Whereabouts are you headed?
You heard that Ern? The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
Muggles? They don't see nothing, do they? Who is that? Who is...? That is Sirius Black, that is. Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black. He's a murderer. Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
Well, that's the question, isn't it? He's the first one that done it. He was a big supporter of... You-Know-Who. I reckon you've heard of him.
Take it away, Ern. Welcome, my children. In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination. In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight. Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. Together we shall cast ourselves into the future. This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves. So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you. What do you see? The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read. But first, you must broaden your minds. First, you must look beyond.
You, boy... Is your grandmother quite well?
I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup. Pity. Broaden your minds. Your aura is pulsing, dear. Are you in the beyond? I think you are. Look at the cup. Tell me what you see.
Give me the cup. Oh, my dear boy. My dear... you have the Grim.
Broaden your minds. You must look beyond. The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye. Only then can you see. Try again. Now, what do we have here? My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class... I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit... for the noble art of Divination. No, you see, there. You may be young in years, but the heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books... to which you so desperately cleave. Have I said something?
He will return tonight.
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder... shall break free. Innocent blood shall be spilt... and servant and master shall be reunited once more. I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something? Greetings my children. I sense even now that many of you have already made the transition into the beyond!
Today we will be continuing our interpretation of prophetic dreams. Please divide into your groups and discuss your recent night time visions using the text as a guide.
I am. These things tend to skip...several...generations.
My dear boy, your dream diary, if you please!
My dear boy! My poor boy! These dreams are evil portends! Yes, yes, oatmeal! Are you telling me you cannot see the signs? The foretelling of suffering and death?
Perhaps you are not as in the beyond as the others.
This is my home! "The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches....Born to
There's more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan.
There's more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan. Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
Relax, boys.  The lights went out is all.  Come, Draco.  We'll be at Hogwarts before you know it.
What's that supposed to mean? But he's there! Potter's there! Someone grab him!
You let us out of here, you filthy squib! Riddikulus!
Hi Harry.
Hello boys. Don't you look... ... dashing.
She looks beautiful.
Harry. Take my waist. Now. It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors... into my pub every other night!
Sirius Black in Hogsmeade! And what would bring him here?
Harry Potter? Nobody's going to come to a pub where they're gonna get scared out of their wits. Why?
Now, tell me what this is all about.
Peter Pettigrew? Ah, I remember him. Never let James and Sirius out of his sight. But what happened?
I don't believe it.
What could be worse? Peter Pettigrew? I will not disappoint you my lord.
Get your hands off me you pathetic little men. Hello father.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours. You know what this means don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.
I'll be welcomed back like a hero. Arthur! It's about time son.
Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter.
Great great pleasure. Shall we? We don't want to be late.
Time to go. Ready?
After 3. One... Two... Three!
Parting of the waves I think old chap, see you at the match.
Let me through! That's my son! My boy! Yes sir.
Alright.
Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...? Right. Hey listen, about the badges. I've asked them not to wear them.
Hey Potter.
How are you? Look I realise I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.
Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor?
It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg and mull things over in the hot water. Get down!
Get off me!
Harry! Harry! You know for a moment there I thought you were gonna let it get me.
Some game huh?
Go. Take it, you saved me! You ok?
Where are we?
It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey. What are you talking about?
What is it?
Who are you? What do you want? Harry take my body back will you? Take my body back to my father. Which of you conjured this?
Do not lie! You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!
Follow me. All of you, this way.
After much deliberation the ministry has concluded that for their own safety no student under the age of seventeen shall be allowed to put forth their name for the tri-wizard tournament. This decision is final.
The rules are absolute, the goblet of fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of tonight... a tri-wizards champion. Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if you will...
The welsh green. Mr Krum...
The chinese fireball. Oooooh. The swedish short-snout. Which leaves...
What's that boy?
The hungarian horntail. These represent very real dragons, each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple, collect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions? Get him another towel.
Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't spoken, after all your story is one I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. Tragic of course, to lose one's family. Never whole again are we? Still, life goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud today Potter.
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this counsel. Should your testimony prove consequential. Counsel may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain in the eyes of the ministry a convicted deatheater. Do you accept these terms? What do you wish to present?
Mr Rosier is dead.
If that is all the witness has to offer... Augustus Rookwood? Of the department of ministries.
Very well. Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime you will be returned to Azkaban.
Silence! Unless the witness possesses any name of genuine consequence this session is now concluded.
What's that?
Yes? The name! Give me the wretched name!
You are no son of mine. Anything from the trolley? Anything from the trolley?
Anything from the trolley dears?
Anything sweet for you dear? Two pumpkin pasties please.
Thank you.
Harry! Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a bit icey at the top.
Yes?
Sorry? I didn't catch that. Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's already asked me. And well I've said I'll go with him.
Harry I really am sorry.
And last year he got through the Triwizard Tournament! Yes, but Luna, it's lost. For centuries now. There's not a person alive today who's seen it.
It's a kind of crown. You know, like a tiara.
Ravenclaw's was rumored to have magical properties, to enhance the wisdom of the wearer. Albus!
You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought Mad-Eye.
I do sir. I have names sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier.
Dead?
I didn't know. No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy.
Ya ya, the same. He passed information to you know who from inside the ministry itself.
NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape, Severus Snape. It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the dark lord.
Oh no no no no no. I heard about one more.
The name... I know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and by means of the cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer Frank Longbottom and...
Barty Crouch! ... Junior.
It's a sign Severus, you know what it means as well as I. Professor Dumbledore, my horses have travelled a long way. They will need attending to.
But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink only single malt whiskey.
Well of course he is lying. Hagrid?
Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming, I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten me.
What is it you want to show me? When we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated. Ahh, c'est magnifique!
Can we get closer? What a charismatic quartet. Hello!
I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily prophet. But of course you know that don't you. It's you we don't know, you're the news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles mask? does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick. Me, myself and I want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers. So, who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall we start with the youngest. Lovely.
This is cosy. You should feel right at home then. Don't mind if I use the quill do you?
So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of twelve..
...about to compete against three students. Not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself but have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned? Course you're not just any ordinary boy of twelve are you...
The story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament.
Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel Harry.  Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? proud? or concerned that your attitude shows at best a pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic deathwish. Harry Potter aged 12, suspect entrant in the tri-wizard tournament. His eyes swimming with the ghosts of his...
Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything goes unfortunately today you might make the front page.
No matter. We've got what we wanted. You have no business here. This tent is for champions and friends.
Write to me. Promise. Parcel for you Mr Weasley.
River, DA calling. Do you read? We have a new weather report: Lightning has struck. I repeat, lightning has struck... Hi Harry.
Is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum??
Are you going to ask me to dance or not? You saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save. My little sister!
Thank you! And you... . You helped!
Au revoir Ron. You are still beautiful to me, William.
Bill, look away -- I'm 'ideous.
He's too weak. This is the closest I could find to what you described, Hermione. Harry when the connection is broken you must get to the portkey. We can delay it for a moment to give you time but only a moment, do you understand?
This should cheer you up, Sirius. Look. Sirius grins.
All right, there, Snivellus? Impedimenta!
And now, the moment you've all been waiting for--
Another charity case, Lily? Nothing. It's more the fact that he exists, you see...
Levicorpus!
I will if you go out with me. Don't make me hex you, Lily.
Fine!
You're lucky Lily was here, Snivellus! Apologize to her! Now!
I would never call you that.
Lily! Hey Lily! You're nearly there, son.
Until the end. Let go. Sweetheart you're ready. Let go! Let go!
Haaaaaaaarry!...
Leave him alone, James Potter! What has he done to you?
Leave him alone, Potter!
I wouldn't go out with you if it were a choice between you and the giant squid! Now let him down. I said, leave him alone!
Then let him go!
Don't make him apologize. Honestly, you're as bad as he is! You make me sick, Potter.
Dear Sirius.  Thank you for Harry's birthday present.  You'd think he'd been born on a broom.
James says he's got the look of a Seeker, but then James would.  We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who dotes on Harry.  Wormy dropped by late in the day, but seemed down and didn't stay long.  James is frustrated being shut up here, but Dumbledore's still got his Invisibility Cloak, so he doesn't have much choice.  By the way, Bathilda tells the most amazing stories about our old Headmaster. I don't know how much to believe. Can it really be true that Dumbledore -- That's mean.
You've been so brave, sweetheart.
We never left, dear. Always... You boys go home now, or I'll be calling your parents!
Arabella Doreen Figg, resident of Little Whinging.
I was sitting on my porch when I saw the two Dementors gliding towards the two boys. Well, they were big and wore great, tattered cloaks.
I-I felt them. It was horrible...like I would never be happy again. Mad-eye, dear, you do realize that's disgusting?
Stop being so cheerful, Mad-eye.
We're there! Perhaps Harry's right, Remus.  To make an Unbreakable Vow, after all --
It was delicious, Molly.  Really.
No, we should go. The first night of the cycle is always the worst -- Sweetheart...
Remus!
My husband, the joker.  By the way, wait until you hear the news! Remus and I are -- Deserves that.  Brilliant, he was. Wouldn't be standing here without him.
He'll sleep 'til dawn and snore like his father. It's you who needs me tonight. There's the first signal.
No one's going to die.
Mad-eye! You, Tonks, and Lupin take Harry! We'll slow them down! They're gone, Alastor.
Clear!
You're more important. The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?
What gave you away?
Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I will handle this side of the castle. Dean!
Who said that? Filth! Scum! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers?!
Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh! Arthur, they've changed the time of Potter's hearing.
It started at eight! You produced a Patronus? A fully- formed Patronus, with a clearly- defined shape?
That is most remarkable, Mr. Potter.
What do you mean? Dementors in Little Whinging?
What did the Dementors look like?
Anything else? Oh, I disagree. She described their effects very completely.
One of the portraits said you'd killed a Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets with that sword in Dumbledore's office. Oh, how the old Mistress would weep to see the traitor in her house...
What's this? The Potter boy in the fire...
Master went out. Master does not tell Kreacher where he goes.
Master will never return from the Department of Mysteries!
Kreacher has been... watching. Kreacher always watches. That was Master Regulus' locket.
Kreacher doesn't know where the other locket is.
Filthy Mudblood -- The Death Eaters will soon be coming for you! Blood-traitor Weasley --
Yes.  It was here, in this house. A most evil object...
Before he died, Master Regulus ordered Kreacher to destroy it. It was the last thing he asked of Kreacher.  But no matter how Kreacher tried, he could not.. He came in the night.  He took many things, including the locket.
Mundungus.  Mundungus Fletcher.
As requested, Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher! I see them too, Harry.
Luna. Luna Lovegood.
There are other ways to fly. I mean, they can fly, and they're
Yes, there is. They're Thestrals. You can't see them unless you've seen someone die.
I'll show you. I do. It's coming from the Veil.
There are people in there!
They hit her with something too. Hello, Harry.
It's the last night and I need to pack.
Oh, people take my things and hide them. I don't think they like me much. Some of them call me "Loony" Lovegood.
Oh no. It all turns up in the end.
Sirius Black. Hermione said he was your Godfather. My mother. I was nine.
It's okay. It's not like I'll never see her again.
Don't tell me you didn't hear them. The voices beyond the Veil? They were just out of sight, that's all.
Of course. Anyway, my mum always said the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. If not always in the way we expect. Think I'll just go have some pudding.
Quibbler...?  Quibbler...? There's an article on Wrackspurts this month.  Quibbler...?
He's lovely.  They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know. Quibbler?
They're invisible creatures that float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. Quibbler?  Quibbler? Hello, Harry.
Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.
It's alright.  I enjoyed our walk. It was like being with a friend. That's nice.
Who are those people?
Would you like me to fix it? Personally I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way.  But it's up to you. No.  But I've done several toes and how different are they really?
Episkey.
Exceptionally ordinary. Hello, everyone.  You look dreadful, Ron.
Is that why you just put something in his cup.  Is it a tonic?
I've never been to this part of the castle.  At least not while awake.  I sleepwalk, you see. It's why I wear shoes to bed. Hello, Harry!
Oh, I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I?  I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.
Very well.  I was bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago. Come, Daddy.  Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.  He's just too nice to say so.
Ron? Harry?
You're bleeding, Harry. That's a curious thing to keep in your sock. Whenever you're ready, sir.
We should close his eyes. Don't you think? There. Now he could be sleeping.
It's beautiful here. Muggles think these keep evil away. But they're wrong...
The sky has lost a star.
My father used to say that when a child died. She looks up, smiles. I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That's why we don't need to talk about it.
Neither am I.
Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem. The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Hasn't anyone ever heard of it? It's quite famous.
Harry! Wait! I need to talk to
Harry -- Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem: 'There's not a person alive who's seen it.'
It's obvious, isn't it? We have to talk to someone who's dead.
He's very impressive, isn't he? If you're to find her, you'll find her down there.
No. I think it best if you two talk alone. She's very shy.
Thanks. Yeah, well, you're going to have to get out of it somehow. We're holding tryouts for Keeper now Wood's gone, and I wanted to have the whole team there.
Well, just...don't do it again!
What about the Anti-Unbridhe League? Harry, you won't believe...that Umbridge woman...this is too much!!
Follow me.
She refused to allow us to reform the Gryffindor team. We had to go to Dumbledore to get her to allow it. I can't believe it...three players banned for life in one day... How do we know You-Know-Who's really back?
Oh please. Professor Lockhart taught us that in second year. I for one would like to know why Potter's qualified and the rest of us aren't. Wow...
Hi, Ron.
Isn't he brilliant? Good luck today, Ron!  I know you'll be brilliant!
Oops.  I think this room's taken.
That's my Won-Won. Where is he?  Where's my Won-Won! Has he been asking for me? What's she doing here?
I happen to be his girlfriend.
Don't make me laugh.  You haven't spoken in weeks.  I suppose you want to make up with him now that he's suddenly all interesting. Ha!  See? He senses my presence. I'm here, Won-Won. I'm here -- I don't know...if it were found...I mean, Umbridge wouldn't like what we're doing... Naturally.
I shouted until someone came. They carried him up seconds ago. He doesn't look good. Covered in blood... Dumbledore, I've just seen them arrive at St. Mungos. Apperated there moments ago. He looks really bad. It's late, Dumbledore...
I'm going, I'm going... Hermy!
Haggar!
Hermy! Where Haggar? Grawp save Hermy! Are you all right, Potter?
Pressure of exams. It happens. Take a breath, and maybe you'll be ready to go back in. Time is nearly up, but--— What are you doing in our forest?
You dare to insult us? The Dark Lord trusts him.
Well, who can one trust these days?
I've nowhere else to turn, Severus. I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself has forbidden me to speak of this --
I... I don't doubt you, Severus.
He's just a boy! Do you mean it, Severus?
Oh, Severus, please, if you would... I would be forever in your debt.
My lord is always welcome here. Is he alive? Draco?
Come, Draco. Merlin's Beard! There's no need to disfigure me, Albus!
It's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?
Yes, well, I couldn't very well use wizard's blood, could I?  Oho! S-someone else?  I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
Oh all right!  The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.  Do you know what that's like?  One can only say no to these people so many times before they...
I never stay anywhere more than a week.  The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands. Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus!  The answer is still no!  Absolutely, unequivocally no!
You look very like your father. Except for your eyes.  You've got --
Lily.  Lovely Lily.  She was exceedingly bright -- your mother. Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born. Oh, but you mustn't think I'm prejudiced!  No, no, no! Your mother was one of my absolute favorites!  Look, there she is. Right up front.
All mine, each and every one.  Ex- students, I mean.  You recognize Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor of the Daily Prophet.
Always takes my owl should I want to register my opinion on the news of the day.  And there's Ambrosius Flume of Honeydukes.  Sends a hamper of chocolate to the house each birthday.  That is, when I had a house.  And Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies -- free tickets whenever I want them. Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time... Ah yes.  Regulus Black.  You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius.  Died a few weeks ago.  I taught the whole Black family except Sirius.  Shame.  Talented boy.  I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set.
Of course.  But you're not leaving?
All right!  I'll do it.  But I'll be wanting Professor Merrythought's old office, not that water closet I had formerly. And I expect a raise!  These are mad times we live in!  Mad! Harry m'boy!  I was beginning to worry!  And I see we've brought someone with us...
Nonsense, we'll sort you out.  Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.  Right then, books out --
Not to worry.  You can get what you need from the cupboard. Now, as I was saying, I've prepared a few concoctions this morning.  Any ideas what these might be?  Yes, Miss...?
One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year...
Now Amortentia doesn't create actual love, of course.  That's impossible.  But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. For that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room. Ah yes...
What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly referred to as --
Yes, Miss Granger.  Desperately tricky to make.  Disastrous should you get it wrong.  But brewed correctly, as this has been, it has remarkable powers.  One sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least until the effects wear off. Because taken in excess it causes giddiness, recklessness and dangerous overconfidence.
Twice.  Once when I was twenty- four.  Once when I was fifty- seven.  Two tablespoons taken at breakfast.  Two perfect days...
So.  This is what I offer each of you today.  One tiny vial of liquid luck... to the student who, in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death, the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your textbook. You should know that in all the years of my previous tenure at Hogwarts, not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize.  In any event -- good luck.
Merlin's Beard!  But it's perfect. So perfect I daresay one sip would kill us all!  Your mother was a dab hand at potions, but this... My, my, what can't you do, m'boy? Perhaps you will save us all in the end...
Here you are then, as promised. One bottle of Felix Felicis.  Use it well. Filius!  I was hoping to find you at the Three Broomsticks.
Harry, m'boy!
Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back.  Longer than I'd care to admit.  In fact, I remember when it was simply One Broomstick! Oops!  All hands on deck, Granger!
Listen, m'boy.  In the old days, I used to throw together the occasional supper and invite a select student or two.  Would you be game?
You'd be welcome too, Granger. Brilliant.  Look for my owl. Good to see you, Wallenby.
To Hogwarts' best and brightest!
So tell me, Cormac.  See much of your Uncle Tiberius these days? Well, be sure to give them both my best.  What about your uncle, Belby?  Working on anything new? For those of you who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.
And you, Miss Granger?  What is it your family does in the Muggle world?
Fascinating.  And is that considered a dangerous profession? Miss Weasley!  Come in, come in.
No matter.  You'll be just in time for dessert.  That is -- if Belby leaves you any.
Thank you, one and all, for a most stimulating evening.  We'll have to do it again. Oh.  Potter.
Ah, yes.  A most intriguing object.  The sands run in accordance to the quality of the conversation.  When it is stimulating, the sands run slow. When it is not...
Nonsense.  You have nothing to fear, m'boy.  As for some of your classmates, well, let's just say, they're unlikely to make the shelf. Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.  Then again... you are already someone aren't you, Harry?
Your mother was modest too.  Your father not so much.  As you can see, he did not make the shelf.
Mr. Riddle had many teachers while here at Hogwarts. Of course.  It's only natural that you should want to know more.  I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.  When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was simply a quiet, albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.  Not unlike the others I've known.  In fact, not unlike... you.  If the monster existed, it was buried deep within.
Someone has taken a BITE out of it. Thank you, Adrian! One of mine.  Class of '78.  I had hoped for more out of him, but at least the pictures are in focus. Oh my!  Excuse me, Harry.  I must greet the new Minister of Magical Transportation.  Class of '67. Mingle, m'boy!  Mingle!  We're all friends here.  And we run the world.
Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew? Good gracious, look at the time. Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays...
Look sharp, Tom.  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours...
Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom? Go on.
I don't know anything about such things and I wouldn't tell you if I did!  Now get out of here at once and don't ever let me catch you mentioning it again!
Now don't forget to look over the chapter on antidotes.  I'll be poisoning one of you next time we meet.  I'm joking!  Off you go! Don't forget your rattails, Miss Alys. Ah! If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself!  To what do I owe the pleasure?
Ask away, my dear boy, ask away!
Yes?  And exactly what was this rare magic. I'm a Potions Professor, Harry. Perhaps your question would best be posed to Professor Snape.
There can be no light without the dark.  And so it is with magic. Myself, I have always strived to live within the light.  I suggest you do the same.
Dumbledore put you up to this. Didn't he?  Didn't he! Damn it all!
Yes???!!!! Oh.  Potter.  It's you.  I'm afraid I'm busy at the moment --
What's the matter with Wenby? Ah.  Very well.  Bring him in.
I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry -- an expert potioneer like you.
Hm.  Perhaps you're right. Yes, well, water under the bridge as they say, correct?
I'll ask you not to use that name.
With all due respect, Dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous Dark Lord who ever lived. Alright, m'boy!  Bottoms up!
A tonic for the nerves.
And a bloody strong one at that. Pick-me-up's what you need, m'boy. Do us all good, I think.  I've got butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a dazzling oak-matured mead.  I had other intentions for this but given the circumstances...
There we are, Potter.  To life!
I d-don't understand -- Hm?  Oh.  Yes... very proud.
Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.
You, Headmaster. I've always cherished my students. They're my life...
Merlin's beard, Harry!
Well, yes, actually -- Why would you think that? Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that I'm familiar with such back alley transactions. One hears rumors is all.  My own interests are purely academic, of course.
Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?
Harry! It's nearly nightfall.  Surely you realize I can't allow you to roam the grounds all by yourself.
Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!
And what makes you say that? Merlin's beard...
Is that an actual Acromantula?
My god, dear man.  How did you ever manage to kill it? I'm sorry, I... didn't realize.
Hagrid.  I wouldn't want to be indelicate, but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare and, well, if you wouldn't mind my extracting a vial or two -- purely for academic pursuits...
My thoughts exactly!  Always carry a few spare ampoules for just such occasions.  Old Potion Master's habit, you know... Why don't I say a few words?  I trust he had family?
Farewell...
Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids.  Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your Forest home.  May your many-eyed descendents ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained. And Odo the hero, they bore him back home...
Sweet.  I once had a fish. Francis.  Lovely little thing. One day I came downstairs and he'd vanished.  Poof.
Isn't it?  That's life, I suppose. One goes along and then... poof. That's never unicorn hair, Hagrid?
Hagrid looks up, reels a bit.  Nods.
But my dear chap, do you know how much that's worth? It was a student who gave me Francis.  One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. There was a flower petal floating upon the surface.  As I watched, the petal sank, but just before it touched bottom... it transformed. Into a wee fish.  It was beautiful magic, wondrous to behold.  The petal had come from a lily.
Your mother.  The day I came downstairs, the day I found the bowl empty... was the day she...
I know what you want.  But I can't give it to you.  It will ruin me... Please don't say his --
Don't think too badly of me once you've seen it.  You don't know what he was like... even then.
Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew? Good gracious, is it that time already?  Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays...
Look sharp, Tom.  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours...
Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom? Go on.
Excuse me?
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed. A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.
One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.  By doing so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed.
That part of your soul that was hidden, lives on.  In other words, you cannot die. I think you can guess the answer to that, Tom.
Yes.  Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature. After, one is never the same.
Seven!  Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person?  To rip the soul into seven pieces... This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?  All academic... Don't know.
Have you ever taken it, sir? Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one.
But then why don't people drink it all the time?
Give me a moment, girls. I know you're going to ask, Harry. But I don't know who cursed me. I've tried to remember.  Honestly. But I just... can't... I must confess to a bit of confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.  In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor. Frankly, I was stunned to find that someone knew of his existence.
I see...
I think I should tell you.  He's a funny boy -- Tom.  Odd.  There have been incidents with the other children.  Nasty things. You've got a visitor, Tom.
Well, I'll leave you two to yourselves. No hard feelings, Weasley, alright?
I'll be going out for Keeper as well.  Nothing personal.
I like my chances.  Say... think you could introduce me to your friend Granger?  Wouldn't mind getting on a first name basis, know what I mean? Hang on.  She's his sister.  How do I know she won't toss him a floater?
Here, here!
Yes, sir.  In fact, I'm meant to go hunting with him and the Minister for Magic over holiday. Slippery little minx, your friend. Likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she?  Yak yak yak. What is this I'm eating, by the way?
My father will hear about this. Katie.  You don't know what it could be!
I warned her!  I warned her not to touch it!
It's like I said.  She went to the loo and when she came back she had the package.  She said it was important she deliver it. Dunno.  He and me dad don't get on. Probably because Dad thinks potions are rubbish.  Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the -- Lovegood, did you say?  I once encountered a seriously unbalanced man by that name at a book signing.  Claimed to run a magazine... Don't you smell clean.
Do it.
Hear that, ugly?  The list says you're lying.  How come you don't want us to know who you are?  Hm? These are dark times, there is no denying.  Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today.  But I say this to our citizenry:  we, ever your servants, continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that would seek to take it from you. Your Ministry remains strong...
I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter.
Don't be coy, Mr. Potter.  Mr. Weasley.  Would you say you were close to your former Headmaster? And you, Miss Granger?  How would you characterize your relationship?
This.  Despite the fact that neither of your friends appear to have been particularly close to their recently deceased Headmaster, he saw fit to remember them in his will.  Now why do you suppose that would be?
Come now, you don't expect me to believe... 'Herein is set forth the Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.  First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, a device of my own making, in the hope that -- when things seem most dark -- it will show him the light.'
'To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.'
'To Harry James Potter, I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill. Not quite.  Dumbledore left you a second bequest:  The Sword of Godric Gryffindor.  Unfortunately, the Sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore's to give away.  As an important historical artifact, it belongs...
The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger.  That does not make it that wizard's property.  And in any event the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown.
The sword is missing. I won't pretend to be your friend, Mr. Potter.  But I assure you I'm not your enemy. Dumbledore said something very similar the last time we spoke.
I came alone.  I don't really need them anymore... Hermione.  Your tea is ready, dear.
Don't you look lovely.  All packed?
Quite sure, dear.  See the big bold letters that say 'Sugar Free'?  Dead giveaway. Darling, don't be suspicious the biscuits taste so good, be grateful the company's so clever... Are you sure these biscuits are sugar-free?
Mm.  Yes. Hello, kitten.  Don't you look lovely. I have heard differently, my lord. Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that the Potter boy will not be moved until the thirtieth of this month, the night before he turns seventeen.
Cattlemole!
It's still raining in my office. Two days now. You do realize I'm on my way downstairs, don't you, Cattermole?
To interrogate your wife!  If my wife's blood status were in doubt and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I think I'd make it a priority.  You've got one hour.
Seal the exits!  Now! No sign of him, my Lord.
Quiet! One hears many things, my lord. Whether the truth is among them is not clear.
As your new Minister for Magic, I promise to restore this temple of tolerance to its former glory. Therefore, beginning today, each employee will be required to submit themselves for evaluation. But know this:  You have nothing to fear... as long as you have nothing to hide...
Sh...careful. But, my Lord, shouldn't we wait -- Severus, please.  We're friends... Hello, Harry.  Bill Weasley.
True enough.  Owe it all to a werewolf by name of Greyback. Hope to repay the favor one day.
Mad-Eye's dead. Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated.
It was our Aunt's. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now as a safe house -- what's left of us, at least.
You're leaving, aren't you. And Griphook?
Listen, I don't know what you're up to, but I know goblins. If you've struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it. If you don't... he won't be forgiving. Technically, I've been coerced. Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. I've always been a huge admirer.
What are you playing at -- setting a pair of bleedin' 'ouse-elves on me!
I'm no thief, you foul little git. I'm a purveyer of rare and wondrous objects -- Listen, I panicked that night, all right?  I never volunteered to die for you, mate.  Can I help it if Mad-Eye fell off his broom --
Why?  Was it valuable?
Wouldn't be difficult, would it? Bleedin' gave it away, din' I? There I was, pitching me wares in Diagon Alley when some ministry hag comes up and asks to see my license.  Says she's of a mind to lock me up and would've, too, she hadn' taken a fancy to that locket. Well, she's right there, in't she? Bleedin' bow an' all. Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!  Xenophilius Lovegood. We live just over the hill!
I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler, unlike those toadies at the Daily Prophet, fully supported Dumbledore during his lifetime and in his death support you just as fully.
What is it? Who are you? What do you want -- Excuse me.
So.  What brings you here, Mr. Potter?
Ah.  Help.  I see.  Yes, well, the thing is, helping Harry Potter, rather dangerous these days... I have expressed that view, yes. In the past.  Would you excuse me one moment.  I shall return shortly and, um, try to help you...
May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots? We make it ourselves.
Luna?  Oh, um, she'll be along. Now how can I help you, Mr. Potter? You mean this?
What is it?  Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course.
The Deathly Hallows.  I assume you're all familiar with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers?' Well, there's no real reason to go on unless one is familiar with the tale.  Why don't you read it aloud, Miss...?
Well, there you are.  Those are the Deathly Hallows.
The Elder Wand... The Resurrection Stone...
... then encloses both in a TRIANGLE. The Cloak of Invisibility. Together... they make the Deathly Hallows.  Together... they make one master of Death.
Ignotus and his brothers Cadmus and Antioch are thought to be the original owners of the Hallows and therefore the inspiration for the story. Ah, but your tea's grown cold. Excuse me, I'll be right back.
The water?
Did, didn't I?  How silly of me. No, you mustn't --
You're my only hope.  They were angry, you see, about what I'd been writing, so they took her. They took my Luna... But it's really you they want...
Him.  Surely you call him You-Know- Who.  But his real name of course is... Voldemort. Stop!  I've got him -- Mr. Potter!  By all means!
I certainly knew him the longest, if you don't count his brother Aberforth -- and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.
Yes, well, Dumbledore was always very private.  Even as a boy. The occasional owl.  Though it was strange...
It was the owls themselves.  They often arrived in distress.  It was clear they'd traveled great distances in some cases.
I'm afraid not.  Albus' messages mostly referenced our days together as schoolboys.  They were surprisingly intimate.  When he did speak of his current activities his words would turn elliptical.  Still, I sensed he was under great stress.  Why do you ask? Well, he treasured you, Mr. Potter, I can attest to that.  I can also tell you that when a person passes, it's only natural to rue the things left unsaid, to regret the question never asked. I knew Albus nigh on 100 years, but in many ways he will always remain a riddle even to me.
That woman is a vulture, Muriel, and you well know it.
I'm sorry you think so, Muriel.  I assure you I was writing from the heart. A monstrous betrayal.  I can only conclude the rumors are true and that she has become untethered.
Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter! Someone has to pick the bones to get at the truth.  I read your obituary, Elphias.  Lovely.  But you did skate over some of the sticky patches in Dumbledore's life.
Yes, well, Rita Skeeter hasn't made that mistake, I'm sure.  Word has it someone talked to her, someone who knew the Dumbledore family well.  You and I both know who that is, Elphias.
Well, I don't suppose it'll be a secret once the book comes out. Bathilda Bagshot. Who? Bathilda Bagshot!  My god, boy, she's only the most celebrated magical historian of the last century.  Don't they read History of Magic at Hogwarts anymore?
She knew the Dumbledores as well as anyone.  She'd have letters, perhaps an interesting photograph or two.  I'm sure Rita Skeeter would have thought it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow to take a peek into that old bird's rattled cage.
For years now.  That's where she first met Dumbledore. Of course.  The family moved there after his father killed those three Muggles.  It was quite the scandal. Honestly, my boy, are you sure you knew him at all? Reg...
Yes.
Yes. But I didn't take it.  I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's, when I was eleven.  It chose me.
But I am!  Tell them, Reg!  Tell them what I am!
You?  It's you! Reg, it's Harry Potter! Just a boy!  Not of the village. It was he who took it.  I never saw it again.  I swear on my life. What's that?  That... smell?
Hello, beautiful.
Your boyfriend'll get worse than that if he doesn't behave, lovely. What happened to you, ugly?
What's your name?
Check the list.  And you, ginger? Like 'ell you are.  We know skinny Stan.  Try again.
Weasley, eh?  Wouldn't be related to that blood traitor Arthur Weasley, would you?
Worth ten times you if I can find him.  Wasn't you that tipped him off, was it? How 'bout you, lovely?  What do they call you...?
You smell like vanilla, Penelope. I think you're going to be my favorite.
Change of plans, boys.  We won't be taking this lot to the Ministry. Now, we won't be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy. You are Potter?
I have something for you... Ah, Tom, I thought you would come one day.  But surely you must know I no longer have what you seek...
You're so innocent, Tom.  Like a schoolboy.  There's so much you don't understand...
Can't you guess, Tom?  It lies with him, of course.  Buried within the earth.  It is he who possesses it, even in death.  Your old friend and mine... Dumbledore. Madam Lestrange. Would you mind presenting your wand?
It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you understand, given the current climate --
I'm afraid I must insist. Very well, Madam Lestrange. If you will follow me.
I'm fully aware of that. I'm also aware the Lestranges are one of our oldest and most respected families.
Let me be specific with you, Ricbert. I've run this bank for forty-five years, long before anyone had even heard of a Death Eater. The day may come that they feel they can run this place better than me, but that day has not yet arrived. Am I understood! Madam, if you will, I will escort you myself.
What the devil are you all doing down here!
Is this your doing, Griphook? You have no rights here anymore. When you gave up your keys, you -- Hm? Oh. Yes. Of course. Put a smile on, Miss Reynolds. Wouldn't want me to have to pay a visit to Daddy again, would you? I do not answer to that name.
Are you a friend of Luna's?
You seek my mother's diadem. Luna is kind. Unlike so many of the others, but she was wrong. I cannot help you.
Many have sought my mother's diadem. Its powers are
But I only wanted to be more like her, clever and wise. She wore it so beautifully, but on me... I grew to hate it... the pain I felt... the pain I feel even now... Another swore to destroy it, many years ago, a strange boy with a strange name...
But he lied.
I know what he's done! I know who he is! He defiled it! With Dark Magic! Strange... you remind me of him a bit...
It's here. In the castle. In the
If you have to ask, you'll never know. If you know, you need only ask... Will there really be thestrals pulling the carriages?
Dad?
What if I'm put in Slytherin? But just say I am --
Really?
Ready. SNAKE!
Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.
Sorry. Fire! You're on fire!
I'm half-blood, I tell you!  My father was a wizard!  Look him up! William Alderton!  He worked here for thirty years... Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.
Not lost are you, my dear?
Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your business. Pleas stand by.
Department of Mysteries.
Department of Mysteries. Reckon the old hag will be interrogating Mudbloods all day? It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, it’s the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet.

We're not supposed to take off, yet. Good job, Harry!
Stay together! And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?
Very well.
Madam Lestrange. Identification.
I see. Very well. Excuse me, won't you?
Next. But... Bogrod, there have been special instructions regarding the Lestrange vault.
Yes, sir, but our instructions are very specific -- Right on your left, ma'am.
9¾? Think you're being funny, do ya? Anything off the trolley, dears?
Don't despair, Elphias.  I'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter.  In 800 pages no less.
Wicked scar. Level Two.  Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including Wizengamot Administration Services, Auror Headquarters and Improper Use of Magic Department. Look, it’s the Bloody Baron!

Is he alright? Hufflepuff, this way! Welcome to Hogwarts.
She's right, you know. Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.
Up! Neville...Neville...
Ha-ha… Ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha…
Ahhh! What's that?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha… Yeah! Come on Slytherin!

There's Nearly-Headless-Nick!
Ooh! Ugh! Yech! Ravenclaws, follow me!
Ohh! Uhh!
Welcome back, Sir Nicholas! Good evening, Sir Nicholas!
Good to see you, Sir Nicholas!
The Grin? What's the Grin? Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim. Taking form of a giant spectral dog. It's among the darkest omens in our world. It's an omen... of death. You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you? With dementors at every entrance?
That's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke. Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Now, how much do you want? Delicious. Make way there. Please! Let me by, madam. Thank you. Excuse me, little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet.
Harry Potter! Excuse me, madam. Argg! RONALD WEASLEY! HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR! I AM ABSOLUTLEY DISGUSTED! YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE, WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME! Oh, and Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud. Thhhhbt! Just stay there!
Hee, hee, hee!
Yeeee-haw! Wheee! Yeah, take it away, Ernie. It's going to be a bumpy ride.
The Leaky Cauldron. If you have pea soup... make sure you eat it before it eats you.
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel. Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock! Ten, nine, eight... seven, six, five... four, three, three and a half... two, one and three quarters. Yes! Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock. They're getting closer, Ernie. Ernie, they're right on top of us! Mind your head. Hey, guys? Guys? Why the long faces? Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there. The Leaky Cauldron. Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
No underage wizards allowed in today! Shut the damn door! Thick heads?! How dare they! Who are they calling thick heads? Young whippersnappers! Housekeeping. I'll come back later. Put that light out!
Watch it there, boy.
We're trying to sleep here! Yes, we are.
Are you deaf? Put that light out! Bloody kids. Good evening! It gives me great pleasure to welcome each and every one of you to the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup. Let the match begin! Blimey, that's one big woman.
He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen yet.
Cedric rules! Like the badge?
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.
Actually he sort of screamed at her, it was a bit frightening. I kept calling. No one came. Come seek us where our voices sound. We cannot sing above the ground. An hour long you'll have to look, to recover what we took.

You stopped us from invoking our punishments on Firenze for becoming the servant of the humans at
We allow you to pass this time, Hagrid, because you have young with you. But the next time you enter this forest, your life is forfeit. What of these two?
They have been here with Hagrid. They have heard the warnings and disobeyed. They must suffer the consequences! They might have gone on to the hall.
Impedimenta!
We've got him! Give me the prophesy!
Well, they've got that right, then, 'aven't they?
That's him!  The real one! We know you're here, Potter. There's no getting away.
Perhaps you need some convincing. Harry Potter.  Who's Harry Potter?
Funny that paper of yours.  Couple nights ago, I could swear I saw one of the pictures move.
Thought I'd gone round the twist. Eleven.  That's when I get off. What'll we have? Dragon tartar?
Just as well.  They give one horribly bad breath. The Ministry has fallen.  The Minister of Magic is dead.  They are coming... Morning, Reg!  Good luck today.
Move it, will you -- oh, Runcorn! Forgive me...
All right, all right.  Let's calm down, shall we? It probably just snuck up here from Experimental Charms.  I think none of us will soon forget last month's Poisonous Duck...
R-Runcorn.
Harry Potter...? Let me guess.  It's raining in Yaxley's office again? There's no Vernon Dudley on 'ere.
He came to us like that. Something he picked up in the forest, I reckon.
