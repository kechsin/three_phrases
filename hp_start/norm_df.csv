albus dumbledore,"I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.
I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.
Hagrid is bringing him.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.
No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
The only family he has.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.
There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all.
Good luck...Harry Potter.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch  has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.
Let the feast...begin.
SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!  Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Back again, Harry?  I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.
Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live.
Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.  Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.
Fine. They're both just fine.
Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.
Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that's saying something.
Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?  It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.  No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Love, Harry, love.  Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee... Mm. Alas. Earwax.
Another year, gone! And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarded and the points stand thus. In fourth place: Gryffindor, with 312 points!  In third place: Hufflepuff, with 352 points!  Second: Ravenclaw, with 426 points!  And in first place, with 472 points: Slytherin house!  Yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account and I have a few last minute points to award.  First, to Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril: fifty points!  Second, to Mr Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years: fifty points!  And third, to mister Harry Potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house: sixty points!
And finally: it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award ten points to Neville Longbottom!  Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order!  Gryffindor wins the House Cup!",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"…They are not.
I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.
Argus! Argus, I… Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except… you three.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"She's not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified.
But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say…
Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution… to all.
There's been another attack.
It means…that our students are in great danger.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.
Harry?
Oh, and about time, too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, and their- their tears have healing powers.
Hagrid.
Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Yes.
No, Harry. I do not think it was you… But I must ask you, is there something you wish to tell me?
Very well, then. Off you go.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Riddle! Come.
It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom.
I'm afraid they are, Tom. They are true.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I understand Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice.
Is there something you wish to tell me?
Very well, then. Off you go.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we…?
I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence.
Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I will, of course, step aside. However, you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.
You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?
And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School.
And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry… first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um… second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?
I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Not intentionally, but yes.
It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?
Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look more closely at this. Be careful.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Ah- it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.
Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I beg your pardon?
Oh, yes.
Voldemort.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this.
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe.
Before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of the recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been canceled.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! Now, I'd like to say a few words... before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin... who's kindly consented to fill the post... of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Good luck, Professor.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher... has decided to retire... in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce... that his place will be taken by none other... than our own Rubeus Hagrid. Finally, on a more disquieting note... at the request of the Ministry of Magic... Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban... until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. Now whilst I've been assured... that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... a word of caution. Dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish... between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you... to give them no reason to harm you. It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. But you know, happiness can be found... even in the darkest of times... if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Make way.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Come on, move.
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
Keep moving!",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Dear lady, who did this to you?
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
Ah, thank you.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Very good.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Quite remarkable, yes.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Many. Each as unlikely as the next.
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it. I'm quite convinced the castle is safe... and I'm more than willing to send the students back to their houses.
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep. For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own. Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Arresto momentum!
No, minister. Over this way.
Yes, that's the... lings you see over there...",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
I'd like to have a cup of tea.
Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on. All right. It'll be all right.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Scabbers?
I do, Miss Granger. But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true... is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. Mysterious thing, time. Powerful... and when meddled with, dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime. If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. If you succeed tonight... more than one innocent life may be spared. Three turns should do it, I think. Oh, and by the way. When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. Good luck.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"It's such a very long name...
Here we are, minister. Follow me. Now, look there.
Look beyond the rocks.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
And all the strawberries, you see?.
Over there.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Over there.
All right.
How extraordinary.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this. How could you? You've been with us all the time.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister. Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy. Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. Thank you.
Well?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Did what? Good night.
Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen...
So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam Maxime.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff.
Igor.
Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks.
For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch.
My dear old friend, thanks for coming.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Silence!
The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's no turning back. As from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun.
Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection!",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum!
The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour
The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Excellent! we now have our three champions! But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup!
Harry Potter. Harry Potter?
Harry Potter!",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?
Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?
You're absolutely sure?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty.
What do you suggest Minerva?
You heard Barty the rules are clear.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you?
Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are.
Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"What are you doing here Miss Granger?
Barty. The bag.
Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon...",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Three of our champions have now faced their dragons and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. And now our fourth and final contestant.
Welcome to the second task. Last night something was stolen from each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures, one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of the black lake. In order to win each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough. Except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. After that they'll be on their own.
You may begin at the start of the cannon.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"The Beauxbatons champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire. She will take no further part in this task.
Harry!
I want all the judges over here now.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory!
For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr Weasly but the others as well. We've agreed to award him second place! For outstanding moral fibre.
A man has died here. And he won't be the last, you must take action.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Then for once show them some.
But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think.
Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I am.
Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.
He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no choice, the evidence was overwhelming. Why do you ask?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Have there been other dreams like this?
I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply...
Cast them away.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now as Mr Diggory...
and Mr Potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...
The first person to touch the cup will be the winner. I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants, gather round.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way.
On the count of three... ONE...
Harry! Harry!",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Tell me what happened!
It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are.
Severus...",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Do you know who I am?
Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Harry get away from there!
Are you alright Alastor?
Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"We'll get you up in a minute.
Barty Crouch Junior.
Your arm Harry.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.
Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes.
Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair minded. And most importantly a fierce fierce friend. I think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort. The ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so I think would be an insult to his memory. Now the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds us that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events the bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain, you remember that. And we'll celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and brave and true right to the very end.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry.
Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared.
No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Witness for the Defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.
Only if the Dementors are still taking their orders from only the Ministry these days. I believe you know my views on this, Cornelius.
Excellent.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I beg a few moments of your attention, as I have a few start of term announcements. Right off, our caretaker, the good Mr. Filch, has reminded me for what he says is the four-hundred and sixty-second time that he had an annually updated list of various banned items, usually introduced by our humour experts Fred and George Weasley...
... which are posted in an extensive list on the door to Mr. Filch's door.
Also, we have two staffing changes this year. Professor Grubby-Plank will be taking the post of Care of Magical Creatures post as Professor Hagrid is on...extended leave.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Additionally, we have Professor Umbridge, who has kindly agreed to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts-—
Professor McGonagall, and...ah...
What can I do for you?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"How did you see this? How were you positioned when you saw it?
Is Arthur seriously injured?
You were listening?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Raise the alarm. We must make sure Arthur is found by the right people.
Many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in other institutions, allowing them to move between them.
Fawkes, we will need a warning.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Naturally, naturally.
What news?
Good.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Minerva, the rest of the Weasleys will need to be awoken.
Phineas.
Phineas, I need you to visit your other portrait. Tell Sirius what happened and that we are coming to stay for a while.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Oh, I agree with you, Professor Umbridge. You do have the power to dismiss my teachers. However...
-..-You cannot send them from this
Happily, that will not be necessary. I have found a successor",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"...the Ministry can only appoint new teachers if I cannot find one. I think you will find him suitable enough.
This is Firenze.
I'm not sure that's true, Professor.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"In point of fact, when young Potter met those students it was not illegal.
Again, quite correct. However, I wonder if you have any evidence that proves this group has been meeting since then?
Correct again. I must confess that I was, however, under the impression that this young girl only told you a meeting was going on tonight.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Again, I cannot have you manhandling my students, Professor Umbridge.
Well, Minister. You've caught me.
Quite correct, Cornelius.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Quiet, Harry!
Ah, yes. I was wondering when we'd hit that little snag.
But I do. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I would 'come quietly.'",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Naturally. All of you did rather well on your spellwork at this school, but if you attempt to take me in by force, I'm afraid I shall have to hurt you.
Are you all right?
I'm not going into hiding. Fudge will soon regret removing me from Hogwarts.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"It's fine. Now listen to me, Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do everything Professor Snape tells you.
Close your mind! You will understand, in time. Fudge is stirring.
Lay back down. They must not think we have had time to talk.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"You should not have come here tonight, Tom.
There are other ways to destroy a man, Tom.
You are quite wrong, Tom, as you have always been.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Stay where you are, Harry!
Harry!
Are you all right, Harry?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"If you and your men will proceed to the Death Room, you will find several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended.
Minister, you have just seen You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds ago! It is time to come to your senses!
If you insist on trying to arrest me, I am perfectly willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I will explain everything, Minister. Just as soon as I return Harry to school.
Minister, you will order the removal of Dolores Umbridge from my school.
All Educational Decrees will be nullified and you will call off the search on Hagrid so he can return to work.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I will return here later tonight, after I have seen to Harry. It should not take long. He taps the Golden centaur head.
Portus.
The Second War has begun, Minister.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Thank you...
Please sit, Harry.
I understand how you feel, Harry--",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry.
There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest strength...
What can't I know?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"This pain is part of being human, Harry...
You do care. You care so much you feel like you will bleed to death because of it.
No.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I daresay I can. And if you actually do attack me with that wand, Harry, I'm afraid to say you will regret it.
It is my fault Sirius died tonight.
Harry, I owe you this explanation, to show you the failings of an old man.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Haven't you wondered why I haven't spoken to you, even looked at you, for months?
Sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. This was Voldemort attempting to manipulate you. To protect you from this, I had you study Occlumency.
Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year.
Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed.
During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form of dreams.
Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius.
Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now.
Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to contact Headquarters.
Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated.
He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated.
I was trying to save his life!",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his weakness. There is an ancient magic which Voldemort has always underestimated.
This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia.
Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt's house your home, you are protected.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders.
Do you remember your first year here? When you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with Voldemort?
Do you remember what you asked me that night?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately, I must.
An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy.
That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to. You and Neville Longbottom.
Voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with Professor Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy. Voldemort had to act immediately, he didn't know the rest of the prophesy. All he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power.
There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which Voldemort has none.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. It states ""neither can live while the other survives.""
It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry.
Yes.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk.  No light could resist it...
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?  The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I'm afraid now is not the time to tell it.  Take my arm.
Indeed.  And quite successfully I might add.  Most people vomit their first time.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry.  I assume right about now you're wondering why I've brought you here, am I right?
Wand out, Harry.
Lumos...",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Horace!
I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.
Dragon's blood.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Ah yes.  Introductions.  Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.  Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. Apparently there's some thought he may be the Chosen One.
So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't perhaps expecting someone else, were you?
Take matters into their own hands?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don't you? Mind?
That was fun.  May I use the loo?
Mind if I take this?  I do love knitting patterns.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I think I know a lost cause when I see one.  Regrettable.  I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace.  You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind.
Indeed they are.
You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values.  Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry.  You would be his crowning jewel.  That is why he is returning to Hogwarts.  And it is crucial he return...",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty. The girl.
You'll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.
Both are waiting for you.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"The very best of evenings to you! First off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn.
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.  Meanwhile the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts will be assumed by Professor Snape.
Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight.  You have a right to know why.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Once there was a young man who, like you, sat in this very Hall. Walked this castle's corridors. Slept beneath its roof.  He seemed, to all the world, a student like any other.  His name? Tom Riddle. The Hall goes utterly silent.
Today, of course, the world knows him by another name.  Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact.  Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle.  But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you.
Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed.  Pip pip!",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Good evening, Harry.  You got my message, I see.  Come, come.  Sit.
So.  How are you?
Enjoying your classes?  Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Do you?
And what of your activities outside the classroom?  Do they bring you satisfaction?
I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger.  One can't help but wonder if --",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Forgive me, Harry, I...
... I was merely curious. In any event, I'm sure you're wondering why I've summoned you here tonight.  The answer lies here.
What you see before you are memories.  In this case pertaining to one individual:  Voldemort.  Or as he was known then... Tom Riddle.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him.  I'd like you to see it.  If you would...
I am not family.  But his name has been known to me since birth.
Perhaps you could give me an example.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"How do you do, Tom.
As you wish.
No.  I am a Professor.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Perhaps they're right.
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
It's a school.  A school of... magic.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"You can do things, can't you, Tom? Things the other children can't.
Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom.
I'm like you, Tom.  Different.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, Tom. Open it.  Open.  It.
Take it out.
Is there anything in that box you ought not to have?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Why did you want these things, Tom?
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts.  At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? I'll be going now, Tom.  Leave your window open tonight.  An owl will bring you a message.  Read it carefully.
It is unusual.  But not unheard of.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time?  No.  Had I...
Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.  Can you guess which teacher that might be?
No.  I did not.  You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... I'd rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry.  But I promise. In time you will know everything.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I did.
Yes.
Confused?  I would be surprised if you weren't.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.  It's also a lie. This memory has been tampered with.  In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn.
I suspect he is ashamed of it.
Why indeed.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you've done so.
Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory.  Any way you can.
You're the Chosen One, Harry.  And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.  You have no choice. You must not fail.
Quick thinking on your part, Harry.  Using a Bezoar.  You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?
Why indeed.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don't by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison.
To whom might I ask?
Ah, to be young and feel love's keen sting.  Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"How is he?  Horace?
This is beyond anything I imagined.  In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific.  I know now... you will see worse.
Oh he succeeded.  And not just once.  Think, Harry.  He's just told us.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"They can be anything.  The most commonplace of objects.  A ring, for example.  Or a book...
It's a Horcrux, yes.  Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley's life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this I knew.  This was a different kind of magic.  Very dark.  Very powerful.  But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful...
Belonged to Voldemort's mother. It was difficult to find and...",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"One destroys Voldemort.
True.  But magic, especially Dark magic...
... leaves traces.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Yes.  And I think... perhaps... I may have found another.  But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone.
Once again, I shall ask too much of you.
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.  I will not negotiate this with you, Severus.  You agreed.  There's nothing more to discuss.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Harry.  You need a shave, my friend.
At times I forget how much you've grown.  At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.  I am an old man.
Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"A trait people never fail to undervalue.  I'm afraid.
The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry.  I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise.  But there is a condition:  You must obey any command I give you -- without question.
Understand what I'm saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Should I tell you to run, you will run.
And should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself...
You will do so.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Your word, Harry.
Take my arm.
Being me has its privileges.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"This is the place.  Oh yes, this place has known magic. Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty...
One wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this cave. What happened is unclear.  But this much is known:  the children were damaged.
In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Oh, no, Harry.  Your blood is much more precious than mine.
Careful.  The water.
It's there.  The only question is how do we get to it?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Perhaps not.
If you would, Harry...
Only recreationally.  You see, I believe one creates one's own luck.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Yes.
Remember... the water.
Oh yes.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"It has to be drunk.
You remember the condition on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me.  It might cause me to forget why I'm here.  It might create so much pain I beg for relief.  You are not to indulge these requests, Harry.  It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat.  Understood?
Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Don't... don't make me...
Nooooooo!!!
Make it stop... Please... make it stop...",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"My fault.  It's all my fault...
Too much... I can't... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY!
Your word, Harry!  Your word!",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Kill me!  It's the only way!
Water. Water...
Aguamenti.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Water!
Go...
We have to... go.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I am not worried, Harry.  I am with you.
No.  Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell him what has happened...
Speak to no one else... I... I shall wait here...",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"No, Harry.  I do not pray.  I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate.
Hide yourself below.  And do not speak or show yourself without my permission.  No matter what.
Do as I say, Harry.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Trust me.
Good evening, Draco.  What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening?  Or is it Summer?
I often talk aloud to myself.  I find it extraordinarily useful. That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. Haven't been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"You are not an assassin, Draco.
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me?  Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.  Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I'm curious.  When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper?
Then I shall make it easy for you.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Well done, Draco.  But I warn you. Killing is not nearly as easy.
You're not alone.  Are you.  There are others.  How?
That cabinet has been broken for years.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Ingenious.  Let me guess.  It has a sister.  A twin.
A passage, yes.  Very good. I once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices.  Let me help you, Draco.
Say that again, Draco.  But aloud this time.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Good evening, Bellatrix.  I think introductions are in order.
Severus...
Severus... please.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"That wasn't my intention.
Stand up, Severus. I haven't much time. What message do you bring from Lord Voldemort this time?
Is this about the Prophecy?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"How much did you relay?
The Prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at the end of July --
If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush?
And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?
Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like you, Severus.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"The boy survives.
He has her eyes.
The Dark Lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger when he does.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If you insist.
Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging.
Perhaps. oOh. Severus.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I was... foolish... greedy...
For the time being?
How long?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Well, this makes matters much more straightforward.
Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of Lord Voldemort's plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?
You must agree.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely.
There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.
On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Lord Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: Harry himself.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him.
But this is touching, Severus. Don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy?
Lily. After all this time?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"The irony of course, Severus, is that -- in the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing...
You cannot help.
Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Oh, yes.
Not.
Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry; the Horcrux he never meant to make.
Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an educated guess.
I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"King's Cross! Is that right? Well, this is, as they say, your party.
You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn't trust
I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor. But I crave your pardon, Harry. It's clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you are the better man.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, because I took it not for gain, but to save others from it. But I took the Stone because I longed to recall someone who has long been at peace and for that I paid with my life.
Yes.
True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they calling you?",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"That is up to you.
Oh yes. We are in King's Cross, you say? I think, should you so decide, you would be able to, let's say, board a train.
On.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"True.
Yes.
'Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.'",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in my
I've never put much stock in miracles, Harry. On the other hand, I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon.
Luck.",Good,2,Dead
albus dumbledore,"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and, above all, those who live without love.
Actually, if I think about it... it doesn't seem curious at all.
Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should that mean that it is not real?",Good,2,Dead
minerva mcgonagall,"Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?
And the boy?
Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are...
This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.
Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while you’re here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily.
We're ready for you now. Follow me.
Will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger.
Draco Malfoy.
Susan Bones.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Ronald Weasley.
Harry Potter.
Your attention, please.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Perhaps if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, that way one of you might be on time.
Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.
Harry Potter?  Follow me.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"You wait here.
Professor Quirrell, excuse me, excuse me. Could I borrow Wood for a moment, please?
Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!
Miss Granger?
Be that as it may be...it was an extremely foolish thing to do.  I would have expected more rational behavior on your part, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment.  As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. Five points...will be awarded to each of you.  For sheer dumb luck.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Good evening.
Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.
Each.  And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.
I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.
How do you know ?",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly.
What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?
Not today, Mr. Weasley. But, I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. Like so. One, two, three, Vera verto. Now it's your turn. Well, who would like to go first? Ah! Mr. Weasley. “One, two, three. Vera verto.”
That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. Yes, Miss Granger?
Well, very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, “pure-bloods.” Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.
Well, naturally, the school had been searched many times. No such chamber has been found.
Well, the Chamber is said to home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"I think- do ya know- I think he's been Petrified, Madame Pomfrey. Look! Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker…
What can this mean, Albus?
What should I tell the staff.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Oh!
This is out of my hands, Potter.
Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. Sherbet lemon.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"This match has been cancelled.
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you have to see.
I warn you, this could be a wee bit of a shock.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"She was found near the Library, along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you?
Could I have your attention please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. “All students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions.” I should tell you this: unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed.
All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second floor corridor, immediately.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.
Well, that's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are a legend.
Ginny Weasley.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Could I have your attention, please?
Now remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege. Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school in anyway that privilege shall not be extended again. No permission form signed, no visiting the village. That's the rule, Potter.
I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign. Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Cornelius!
Professor Dumbledore does not want dementors around the place, I can assure you.
Well. Now years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death... You remember? They went into hiding. Few knew where they were. One who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who!",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Yes, little lump of a boy. Always trailing after Sirius Black.
Well Peter Pettigrew tried to warn the Potters... and might have managed to, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Yes. Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters, but he's the reason they're dead.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Mhmm.
This: Sirius Black was... and remains to this day... Harry Potter's godfather!
Little lump of a boy. Always trailing after Sirius Black.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"This can't go on Albus. First the dark mark, now this?
Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.
Well the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accomodate them...",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy not a piece of meat.
Professor Moody what are you doing?
Is that a student?",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"We never use transfigration as a punishment, surely Dumbledore told you that.
Well you will do well to remember it.
The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. As representitives of the host school I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.
Now to dance is to let the body breathe, inside every girl a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight.
Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join me.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Now, place your right hand on my waist.
My waist.
Now bend your arm. Mr Filch...",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"One two three, one two three, one two three.
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?
To dance. It's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance. Surely I told you that.
Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great hall with Miss Patil.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Good. Off you go.
Potter!
Where on earth are you going at this time of night?",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"What?
Yes, I think you might be right, Potter. She looks at Harry.
Well, give her to me. I'll run her",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"There you are.
Bear in mind, Potter, that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts are being watched, won't you?
Good. Now, off to bed.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"My office. Now.
In all my thirty-nine years at this school, I have never seen such a disgusting display.
Of course he wanted to provoke you! He'd just lost!",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"I cannot express in words the disappointment I feel right now.
What is it, Dolores?
You thought wrong. Now kindly remove yourself from my office.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Now, I don't care what Malfoy said. Your performance out there was shameful. Fifty points from Gryffindor, and I'm giving you both a week's worth of detentions.
My hands are tied, Potter.
Potter!",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Wake up, Potter. Wake up. Please...
You dreamed this, Potter?
You're sure this happened, Potter?",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"We're going to see the Headmaster, Potter.
Well, Potter has had some kind of nightmare...
Yes, we're fine.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"History of Magic is up, ladies, not down.  Mr. Davies -- that's the girl's toilet...
Potter!
Enjoying ourself, are we?",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"So I noticed.  I would think you'd want to fill it with Potions.  Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?
And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with 'Exceeds Expectations.'
Good.  And take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the Three Broomsticks, Leanne?
Did she say to whom?
All right, Leanne.  You may go. Why is it always you three?  Hm? When something happens?",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Severus. Is this it?
Yes.  She was cursed.
That's a very serious accusation, Potter.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"I suggest you return to your dormitory.  All of you.
I think we all agree that Mr. Potter's actions were heroic.  The question is:  Why were they necessary.
To your Houses.  No dawdling.",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,"Potter.
Potter, in light of what's happened... should you feel the need to talk to someone...
You should know... Professor Dumbledore...",Good,2,Undead
minerva mcgonagall,You meant a great deal to him.,Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.
No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.
Sorry 'bout that.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.  Boy, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!
Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself.  Words and all. Heh.
It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts.
No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?
You're a wizard, Harry.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.
Well, just Harry. Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared?  Ah.
A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?
Non magic folk.  This boy's had his name down ever since he was born!  He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Never, insult Albus Dumbledore, in front of me.
Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off.  Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm?",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Essential bit of equipment, Harry.
Well, they don't mean for a penguin, do they? Heh. Crikey, but not a dragon.
Fast and misunderstood beasts, Harry. Fast and misunderstood.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"If you know where to go.
No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.
Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh.
See, Harry, you're famous!
I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry.  Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.  Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Well, there's your money, Harry.  Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.
They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me.  Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.
Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. There's the little devil.  Oh, and there's something else as well.  Professor Dumbledore gave me this.  It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing now, did ya?
Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.
Best not mention this to anyone, Harry.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.  No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.
Harry! Harry! Happy birthday!
You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...
No, I can't spell it. All right.  Voldemort.
Shh!!",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"It was dark times, Harry, dark times.  Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em.  Nobody...not one. ‘Cept you.
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.
Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"What're you looking at?  Blimey, is that the time? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his- well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket.  Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.
Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!
Hello, Harry.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.
Well done!
What's going on with Harry's broomstick?",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Go go go!
Looks like he's gonna be sick!
Yes!",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry’s broom?
Who told you ‘bout Fluffy?
Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the..",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Shouldn’t have said that. No more questions! Don’t ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.
Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"I shouldn't said that. I should not have said that.
Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today.
Oh.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?
Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!
You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.  Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that.  Oh!  Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
That? It's a ... its um...
I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert.
Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?  Don't you, Norbert?  Dededede.
Ohh!  Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course.  Who's that?",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Oh, dear.
Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.
Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?  What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Right. Let's go.
What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something.  So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.
And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward.
Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry?
I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem.""
Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.""
I shouldn't have told you that. Where you going?! Wait!",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Yes!
Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.
Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja?  This is for you.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Oh. Go on...on with you.  Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.
I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh?  Off you go.
Harry?",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"What do you think you're doing down 'ere? Come on!
Yer a mess, Harry. Skulkin' 'round Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place! Don' want no one ter see you there. People'll think you were up to no good.
Me? Oh, I was… um… I was lookin' for Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. They're ruinin' all the school cabbages.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Hello, Hermione!
You'll be all right now then, Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it, then.
Wo, this calls for a specialist's equipment. Nothin' to do but wait'll it stops, I'm afraid.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Better out than in. Who's Ron tryin' to curse, anyway?
He did not!
See, the thing is, Harry, there're some wizards, like the Malfoy family, who think they're better'n everyone else because they're what people call “pure blood.”",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"And it's codswallop, to boot. “Dirty blood.” Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half blood or less. More ter the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can' do. Come here… Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't you think on it for one minute… eh?
Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger! That's been tampered with, that has!
Broken? There's no bones left!",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry!
In fact, I'd be prepared ter swear it in front o' the Ministry of Magic!
Well, of course you don't, and… Oh… Oh, right. Well, I'll, umhum. I'll just wait outside, then.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Let's get yeh out of there.
You can't! You don't understand.
It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one! Never!",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"No!
No!
Aragog! Aragog!",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me now, would ya?
Oh, It's a- Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, ya know. Now, accordin' to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit o' growing up to do. But, once their acne's cleared up, we'll be able to chop 'em up and stew 'em, and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified. In the meantime, though, you three had best be lookin' after yourselves. All right? Hmm.
Hello, Neville!",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Who's there? Hello? Hello?
Oh, nothing. I- I was expecting, ah… It doesn't matter- come on inI just made a pot o' tea.
I'm fine! I'm alright.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all righ'.
What you had to understand about that is—  Quick under the cloak. Don't say a word. Be quiet, both o' you… Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Of course! Come in! Come in.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Oh, but I never- you know I never, Professor!
Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban Prison?
What're you doin' here? Get outta my house!",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Yeh can' take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! You mark my words, there'll be killin's next!
Ahem! If, uh, if anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yup! That would lead them right! That's all I have to say. Oh, and someone'll need to feed Fang while I'm away.
Sorry I'm late! The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And I'd just like to say that aif it hadn't been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione, o' course, I woulduh- I'd still be you-know-where, so I- I'd just like to say 'Thanks.'",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Oh!
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer. Less talking, if you don't mind. I got a real treat for you today. A great lesson. So follow me. Right, you lot. Less chattering. Form a group over there. And open your books to page 49.
Just stroke the spine, of course. Goodness me.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Isn't he beautiful? Say hello to Buckbeak.
That, Ron, is a hippogriff. First thing you wanna know about hippogriffs is that they're very proud creatures. Very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff. It may just be the last thing you ever do. Now, who'd like to come and say hello? Well done, Harry. Well done. Come on now. Now... you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So... step up. Give him a nice bow. Then you wait and see if he bows back. If he does, you can go and touch him. If not... Well, we'll get to that later. Just make your bow. Nice and low. Back off, Harry. Back off. Keep still. Keep still. Well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you. Right. I think you can go and pat him now. Go on. Don't be shy. Nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow. Not so fast, Harry. Slow down, Harry. That's it... Nice and slow. Now let him come to you. Slowly, now, slowly, slowly... That's it... Yes! Well done! Well done, Harry, well done! I think he may let you ride him now.
Come on.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Put you over here, just behind the wing joint. Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that. Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
Well done, well done. How am I doing me first day?
Malfoy, no... No! Buckbeak! Whoa, whoa, whoa... Whoa! Buckbeak! Away, you silly creature!",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Calm down! It's just a scratch!
I'm the teacher. I'll do it.
Class dismissed!",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Allow me, minister.
Sorry about that.
Well, first off, the committee members took turns... talking about why we were there. And then I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak... was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. And then Lucius Malfoy got up. Well, you can imagine. He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature... who would kill you as soon as look at you.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
No, I'm not sacked. Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore... would get into trouble. He's coming down, you know? Dumbledore. Says he wants to be with me when they... When it happens. Great man, Dumbledore. A great man.
You'll do no such thing! Think I want you seeing something like that? No. You just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron...
Keep a closer eye on your pets, Ron.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Blimey! What was that?
Oh, crikey.
It's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here. Someone sees you outside the castle at this time of night, you'll be in trouble. Big trouble. Particularly you, Harry. With you in a moment! Quick. Quick!",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Go on, go on!
Professor Dumbledore.
Minister. Just make your way through. Have a tea, if you like.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Dear, dear...
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Keep a closer eye on your pet, Ron.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Buckbeak.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
Clear the runway.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"No... No.
Did you bring your father's cloak like I asked you?
You'll see soon enough. Pay attention this is important.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"As a matter of fact I have. You might like to try the same thing now and again.
Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on.
Bonsoir Olympe.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Couldn't forget you Olympe.
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.
Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood creatures.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Although, I have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you know.
Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped bring him over from Romania. Didn't Ron tell you that?
I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well, she left when I was about three. No, not the maternal sort her, broke my dad's heart though. You know he was a tiny little fellow my dad, I could pick him up with one hand by the age of six and put him up in the dresser.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"And then he died when I was still in school. So I had to make me own way as it were. But enough of me, what about you!
So I remember, I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded me of myself a little. And here we all are, four years later.
Maybe. But we've all got each other, and Harry of course. Soon to be! The youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's ever been! Hooray!",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"I've fine, I tell yeh!
Can' answer tha', I'm afraid. Top secret, that is. Business of the Order.
Oh. Well, yeah, I was, then. Went with Madame Maxime. Took us a month to get to their camp.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"O' course! Can' do magic, not with the Ministry followin' us all the way. Plus, giants aren't fond o' wizards. Don' trust 'em.
Well, not righ' away. We brought our message, an' I expec' a fair few'll remember it afore teh end comes.
Its jus' up ahead, here.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"All righ'. Well, I'm showin' yeh this, because tha' Umbridge woman put me on probation. I can' last much longer afore I get sacked like Trelawney.
Knew yeh'd say yes!
Okay, real quiet like from here on.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"There we are!
None o' them did, Hermione! I didn' have much ruddy choice inna matter! I couldn' leave 'im!
He's me brother!",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Well, half-brother anyway. Me mum had 'im afore she died.
Here. I'll introduce yeh to Grawp!
Yeh all righ', Grawp?",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Look wha' I brough' yeh, Grawpy! Two new friends an' all. We 'ave Harry Potter here, see? An' over here is Hermy.
Bad Grawpy! Bad boy!
We don' attack our friends, Grawpy!",Good,2,Undead

Anyway, all yeh need teh do is go an' talk to 'im. Give 'ima bit o' company.
Oh blimey...",Good,2,Undead

Stopped yeh from committin' murder, yeh mean!
Well, you'll tolerate 'im as long as he's here!",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Hey, you three!
Stinksap.  Burn the whiskers right off yer chin.  Trees 'ere are drippin' with it.
It's not fer me.  It's fer Aragog. Yeh remember Aragog, don' yeh?",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"Tha's the one.  He's taken ill. I'm hopin' ter nurse 'im back. Keep yer fingers crossed.
Get back!  All o' yeh!
Now, now.  Now, now...",Good,2,Undead

Kill 'im! Me oldest friend, 'e was!",Good,2,Undead

I reckon that too... How'd yeh get outta the castle anyways?
Don' suppose it's doin' 'im any good, izzit?",Good,2,Undead

Aragog.
Tha' was... tha' was... beautiful.",Good,2,Undead

I had 'im from an egg, yeh know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.  No bigger'n a Pekinese.
Tha's odd.",Good,2,Undead
rubeus hagrid,"No idea... no idea at all...
Take more'n tha' ter finish me off.  Not sure about me 'ouse, tho'.  But if anybody can put it righ', Dumbledore can.
Only thing I can't reckon is wha' Snape was doin' with tha' lot.",Good,2,Undead

All righ', 'arry?  Yeh look fit.
Brought yeh here sixteen years ago when you were barely bigger than a Bowtruckle. Seems only righ' I should be the one ter take yeh away.",Good,2,Undead

Haven't go' any brandy, have yeh, Molly?  Fer medicinal purposes?
Someone else is back.",Good,2,Undead

Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Ha! No blasted letters today. No, sir. Not one single bloody letter, not one.  No, sir, not one blasted, miserable-
Go away, ahh!
Give me that! Give me that letter!",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"Ahh!
That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
Who's there? Ahh!",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!
He'll not be going! We swore when we took him in, we’d put a stop to this rubbish!
He'll not be going!",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
Harry Potter!
I'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird it'll have to go.",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!
I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
Which should be any minute! Ahem…Now let's go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be…?",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"Good! And- and Dudley, you will be…?
Excellent! …And you…?
Too right, you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. And you will not mess it up!",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
Ohh, don't mind that! It's just the cat.
So when they arrive at the ninth hole…",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"What the devil are you doing up here?
You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!
One more sound, and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy! And fix that door!",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"…it spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this vast building, and it was this deep. And one plumber said “Look at all that water.” A-and the second plumber said, “Yes, and that's just the top of it!”
I'm so sorry! It's my nephew- he's very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him. That's why I kept him upstairs!
You're never going back to that school. You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"Now, what the hell's he doing? Potter!
Petunia, he's escaping!
Come here!",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere!
No! No! No! No! Aaaah!
Oh… Damn.",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"What is it?
Later perhaps, if you behave.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs!",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"Can I tempt you, Marge?
St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
I think it's time you went to bed.",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"Ow! Ripper! Ow! Ripper, get down, boy! Down! Ripper, stop it! Stop! I've got you, Marge! I've got you! Hold on, hold on! Get off!
Sorry!
Oh, God! Marge! Please! Marge! Come back! You bring her back! You bring her back now and you put her right!",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"You're not allowed to do magic outside school.
They won't let you back now. You've nowhere to go.
What the heii are those?",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"What the hell is a dementoid?
I want some answers!
By those...things?",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"How do you know that?
Fought 'em off, eh, Dud? Gave 'em the ol' one-two?
Why is he all right then?",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"Who are all you lot?
Come now, Dudley.  Hurry up!
Well, this is goodbye then, boy.",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"Who?
Absolutely not.
Well, because -- he doesn't want to, do you, boy?",Bad,2,Undead
vernon dursley,"Come on, Dudley, we're off.",Bad,2,Undead
harry potter,"Yes, Aunt Petunia.
Yes, Uncle Vernon.
He's asleep!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.  Can you...hear me?  It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often?  You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family?  I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.
Anytime.
Ow!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I swear I don't know!  One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!
Will I have to wear that, too?
But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old Elephant skin.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hey, give it back! It's mine!
Because there's no post on Sunday?
Get off! Ahh!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"They're my letters! Let go of me!
Make a wish, Harry.
I-I am.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Thank you!
Excuse me, who are you?
Sorry, no.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Learned what?
I-I'm a what?
No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?
Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Muggle?
Okay.
First year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"One pair of dragon-hide gloves.  Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?
But you like a dragon?
All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Could we find all this in London?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Oh, nice to meet you.
Goodbye.
But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.
Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?
What's in there, Hagrid?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I still need...a wand.
Hello? Hello?
Sorry, but what's curious?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"And...who owned that wand?
Wow.
He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Maybe if you wrote it down?
Voldemort?
Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What happened to...to You-Know-Who?
Platform 9¾? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9¾. There's no such thing...is there?
Excuse me, excuse me.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9¾?
Muggles?
Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to-",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No, not at all.
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
The what?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Oh
We'll take the lot!
Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?
I got Dumbledore!
Hey, he's gone!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"A little.
Yeah!
Hey, Hagrid.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.
Ahh!
Nothing... nothing, I'm fine.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.
Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin.
Wow.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?
What's he teach?
I think she fancies you.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"We got lost.
I don't know, sir.
I don't know, sir.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Clearly, Hermione knows. Since it's a pity not to ask her.
What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
Can I borrow this?  Thanks.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts, listen.  Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.
Wow.
Neville!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Give it here, Malfoy.
Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!
A century, according to McGonagall.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?
I-I didn't know.
Who doesn't?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What's happening?
Let's go this way.
Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Let's go.
Run!
Quick! Let’s hide though that door!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"It's locked!
And for good reason.
Guarding something?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I think so. What are those?
What is that?
I like this ball.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What do I do with it?
Whoa.
I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I think she heard you.
Where's Hermione?
How could a troll get in?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hermione! She doesn't know!
It’s going into the Girl's Bathroom!
Hermione, move!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Whooa! Whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa whoa!
Do something!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Anything! Hurry up!
I don't think so. Just knocked out.  Ew. Troll bogies.
Well, what it is...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Good for you to get us out of trouble like that.
Mind you, she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her.
I'm not hungry.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"That explains the blood.
Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.
The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
But I-I never get mail.
It's a broomstick!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But who...?
A little.
What happened?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yes!  Whoa!
Yes!
Whoa! Whooa!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?
Yes?
But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Exactly.
Nicholas Flamel?
Nicholas Flamel.  Who's Nicholas Flamel?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Knight to E5.
Happy Christmas, Ron.  What are you wearing?
I-I've got presents?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.
It's some kind of cloak.
My body's gone!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'm invisible?
There was no name. It just said use it well.
Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Mum?  Dad?
Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this!  Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!
There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!
Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad
How can it? Both my parents are dead.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No.
No.
So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hi, Hedwig.
Malfoy.
I found him!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Go on.
I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.
The what?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Shh!
Hagrid!
We know about the Philosopher's Stone!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"We think Snape's trying to steal it.
Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.
What?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Wait a minute.  One of the teachers?
Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?
Norbert?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Malfoy.
Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.
I don't understand. Is that bad?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"50?!
Hagrid, what's that?
If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What is it, Fang?
But what was that thing you saved me from?
But who would choose such a life?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
The Philosopher's Stone.
But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself; he wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight.
My scar. It keeps burning.
Not like this.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh!  Oh. Of course!
Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?  I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?  What did he look like?
The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!
He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Someone's going to try and steal it.
That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.
We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Trevor.
Now, Neville, listen. We were
Let's go.  Sorry.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp.
We have to move its paw.
Come on!  Okay. Push!  I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign.  If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Jump! Go!
Whoa!  Oh. Ahh!
Hermione!!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hermione! Where are you?!
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Apparently not.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What?
Ron, are you okay?
Okay.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
I don't know. Sounds like wings.
They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I don't know. Strange.
There! I see it!  The one with the broken wing!
It's too simple.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Catch the key!
Where are we? A graveyard.
There's the door.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Wait a minute.
No, Ron! No!
He's going to sacrifice himself!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"RON!  NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing.  Checkmate.  Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.
Not as good as you.
You?  No. I-it can’t be. Snape, h-he was the one—-",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me.
Snape was trying to save me?
Then-then you let the troll in.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I-I’m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I’ve won the House Cup.
Voldemort.
Never!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You liar!
Admirers?
Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But, what happened to the Stone?
But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?
How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?
What is it?
All right there, Ron?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"All right. Hermione?
One minute.
Thanks, Hagrid.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.
I'm not going home. Not really.
I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon…",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Now you've done it.
But she's bored! If I could only let outonly let out for an hour or two.
But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends… not one… all summer.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist.
Who are you?
Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Why don't you sit down?
Dobby, ssh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to offend you, or anything.
You can't have met many decent wizards then.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Stop, Dobby!
Dobby, shh!
Dobby, please stop!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please be quiet! Are you all right?
Your family?
What terrible things? Who's plotting them?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ok– I- understand. You can't- say.
Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down.
Give me the lamp! Dobby stop!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Get in there, and keep quiet!
I- I was just—
Sorry.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yes, sir… See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. It's the only place I've got friends!
Well, I expect they've… been- hang on- how do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?
Give me those, now!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Dobby, get back here!
Dobby, please, no!
I can't. Hogwarts is my home!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ron! Fred. George. What are you all doing here?
Ahh- ahh!
Let go of me!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Get off!
I think it's brilliant
Hello. W-what did I do?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Raids?
Oh, sorry sir. I'm Harry, sir, Harry Potter.
Oh, it…",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Oh, umm…
Floo powder?
'Diaganilly.'",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'm fine, thank you. I- I was just…
No! Please!
Hagrid!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I was lost, I— hang on. What were you doing down there, then?
Well, it's great to see you, too!
I definitely need to remember that one.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Thank you. Bye.
Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.
Let's go.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Aah!
Sorry. Lost- lost control of the trolley. Why can't we get through?
The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock. We've missed it!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.
Well come on, then. Let's go lower. We need to find the train.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Now all we need to do is catch up with the train.
Do you hear that?
Hold on…",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Aaahhh! Aaahhhh! Aaahhh!
Wha-aahhh!
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I think we found the train.
Up! Up!
Up! Up! Ron! Mind that tree!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ahh!
Be thankful it's not your neck.
I don't know.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Aaaahhhh!
Come on! Go! Fast!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ahh!
See you, Hedwig. So, a house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters, we almost get killed by a tree… clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You're doomed.
Oh- Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.
Stop! Stop! Hold still!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Malfoy?
No, Colin! Get out of the way! Let's take him to Hagrid's.
He'll know what to do.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ah! Oh… Okay.
Malfoy. He called Hermione, …um, well, I don't- I don't know exactly what it means.
What's a Mudblood?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"That's horrible!
Not really.
What?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"That voice.
Didn't you hear it?
Spooky.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Did you hear it?
That voice.
I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just—",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"It's moving. I think it's going to kill.
Strange. I've never seen spiders act like that.
Oh, no… It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No. No.
It's not true sir, I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris.
When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Strange?
Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean?
Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means---",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
Well, how long will it take to make?
A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Wood! Look out!
Thank you.
No, I think my- I think my arm's broken.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No, not you.
Ugh!
Uh!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Dobby?
It was you… You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
You nearly got Ron and me expelled!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!
I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Why do you wear that thing Dobby?
Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
Dobby, stop it! Stop it! Stop, Dobby! Tell me, Dobby. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?
Thank you, sir.
You wish.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Rictusempra!
Sya- hassa- she. Sya- hasi- heth. Sya- hasi- heth.
I'm a what?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Uh, once! But, so what? I bet loads of people here can do it.
What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin.
You were there! You heard me!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I spoke a different language? But- I didn't realize I- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
But I'm not… I can't be.
I'll see you back in the common room.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No! Mr. Filch! Y-you- you don't understand!
Professor… I swear I didn't!
Professor Dumbledore?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I… I-I was- I was just wondering if you'd put me in the right house.
You're wrong.
Professor! Sir, your bird- there was nothing I could do- he- he just caught fire!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You don't think it was me, Professor?
No, sir. Nothing.
Crabbe and Goyle.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ron, maybe I should do it?
Wingardium leviosa. Here they come.
Come on. Let's get 'em.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ughh!
Ron!
We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Excellent.
Hermione, are you okay?
Come on.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
I'm…
Ah- um… Reading.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Uh-huh.
You're wrong!
Harry Potter?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
It's his… stomachache. Calm down.
Hair!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you!
Hermione? A- are you OK?
She should be out of hospital in a few days, when she stops coughing up fur balls… What's this?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
Why would I throw something at you?
But, who threw it at you, anyway?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"'Tom Marvolo Riddle.'
'My name is Harry Potter.'
'Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?'",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"'Can you tell me?'
Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here? Are you Tom Riddle?
Dumbledore?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hagrid! Haagriid!
Woah!
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chanter of Secrets fifty years ago.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?
No!
W- what's that you've got, Hagrid?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"And they found it. Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
No.
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I think it's time to get my Dad's old cloak out again.
What's that for?
Hagrid, are you okay?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Did you hear about Hermione?
Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?
Look! Well, come on. Come on, Fang!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You heard what Hagrid said; 'Follow the spiders.'
Shush!
Come on!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Don't panic.
We're friends of Hagrid's. And you? Y- y-you're Aragog aren't you?
He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Then you're not the monster.
Shush. But if you're not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?
But have you seen it?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What?
Well, thank you. We'll just…go.
One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Let's go! Arania exumai! Go!
Whoah!
Arania exumai!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Don't mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on! Move faster!
Aah!
Go on! Go! Get us in the air.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Come on! Pull!
We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.
Wish you were here Hermione. We need you… now, more than ever.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ron, this is why Hermione was in the Library the day she was attacked. Come on!
'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it.' Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake!
Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin…Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it- but he's a ghost- he couldn't die again. And Hermione…had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection. 'Spiders flee before it.' It all fits!
Hermione's answered that, too.
Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know.
Professor, we have some information for you! Are you going somewhere?
You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You wrote them!
You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!
Don't even think about it.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"To ask you how you died.
Who was it Myrtle?
Just like that? How?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.
Hesha- Hassah.
Oh, yes there is! You first.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"All right. Let's go.
Uh…thanks Myrtle.
Aaah!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway.
This way.
It's a snakeskin.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ron! Ron, are you ok?
You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny!
Hesha- Hassah.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ginny… Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please, wake up!
Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, 'she won't wake?' She's not…?
Are you a ghost?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up! You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk.
Give me my wand, Tom.
Listen, we've got to go! We've got to save her!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No. She couldn't. She wouldn't!
But why?
But, why did you want to meet me?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?
I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
You! You're the Heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort.
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes?
Ginny-
Ginny…",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough… Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! It's alright, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"It's just… You see, sir I- I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle and me.
Voldemort transferred some of his powers… to me?
So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Because I asked it to.
Godric Gryffindor.
Dobby! So this is your master! The family you serve is the Malfoys",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Don't worry. I will be.
Sir, I wonder if I could have that?
Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley.
Open it.
Just promise me something.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Never try to save my life again.
Well, we had loads of help from you. We couldn't have done it without you.
Well, there's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima!
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
Nothing. School stuff.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I will if she does.
Yes.
Okay.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.
That's a lie!
My dad wasn't a drunk!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Shut up! Shut up!
No! She deserved what she got! Keep away from me.
Yeah? Try me.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I don't care. Anywhere's better than here.
I fell over.
I didn't do it on purpose.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Nothing.
I didn't.
The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
Who is that? That man.
How did he escape?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yeah. Him I've heard of.
Hedwig.
No, thank you. Minister?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I don't understand.
I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
The state of things, sir?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sirius Black, you mean? But what's he got to do with me?
Hedwig.
Egypt. What's it like?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Mrs. Weasley.
Good to see you.
Yes.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yeah, it's all upstairs.
Everything's there.
Thank you.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Mr. Weasley.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah. It should be great.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
Voldemort.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sorry.
And kill me.
Mr. Weasley... why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I didn't mean to blow her up. I just... I lost control.
I think I was lucky not to be arrested actually.
Do you think he's really asleep?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I gotta tell you something.
Yeah.
Thanks, Ron.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I don't know. Maybe we've broken down.
Thank you.
What was that thing that came?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What happened to me?
And did either of you two... you know... pass out?
But someone was screaming. A woman.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"How did he find out?
Fortuna Major.
Thank you.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"She's still doing that after three years. She can't even sing. Exactly. Hey, man. Hey, man. Oh, God. That's awful.
Shut up, Malfoy.
What?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hey, hey, hey!
Brilliant, professor.
At least Hagrid didn't get fired.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But professor I thought if you signed it, then I could...
Forget about it, guys. See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I did think of Voldemort at first. But then I remembered that night on the train... and the dementor.
Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman... screaming.
I think it was my mother... the night she was murdered.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"The most haunted building in Britain. Yeah I know. What's going on?
Excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin?
Sir, it's Quidditch tomorrow.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
Oh, brilliant.
What happened?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Really? I meant the match. Who won?
No. Professor, why do the dementors affect me so? I mean, more than everyone else?
I'm scared, professor.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me. You made that dementor on the train go away.
But you made it go away.
Guys, let me go.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...
What are you doing?!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What's this rubbish?
Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... are proud to present the Marauder's Map.
Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that... No. Is that really...?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"So you mean this map shows...
Everyone?
Brilliant! Where did you get it?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"He was their friend... and he betrayed them. He was their friend! I hope he finds me. Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready! When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
I'm sure.
Expecto Patronum.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Expecto Patronum! Expecto... Expecto... Expect...
That's one nasty dementor.
The first time I rode a broom.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"There's another. It's not... happy, exactly. Well, it is. It's the happiest I've ever felt... but it's complicated.
Just do it. Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum!
I think I've had enough for today.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I was thinking of him. And Mom. Seeing their faces. They were talking to me. Just talking. That's the memory I chose. I don't even know if it's real. But it's the best I have.
Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?
They're not sacking you!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You tell those spiders Ron.
Sorry.
Mischief managed. Nox.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I was sleepwalking.
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Spare bit of parchment.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs... offer their compliments to Professor Snape and...
And request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.
No. No, sir.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yes, sir.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works. Earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead.
Peter Pettigrew.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"It's just what I saw. Good night, professor.
Hang on. We better take this back.
Fine. See you later.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Professor Trelawney...
Sorry?
No. Nothing.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Why don't we just set him free?
Ow! Hagrid!
Hagrid. It'll be fine. It'll be okay.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What?
Wait!
That's not good. Ron, run!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ron! Ron! Ron! Ron! Come on! Move!
Don't worry.
I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Come on. Ron.
Then it'll be you!
I know why. You betrayed my parents. You're the reason they're dead!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Who was it, then?
Expelliarmus!
Tell me about Peter.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
The map was lying, then.
All they could find of Pettigrew was his...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Show me. Give it to him, Ron.
No!
I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the dementors can have you.
Okay.
No. Don't worry, okay? It's fine. I'll stay.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You okay?
Well I just didn't think my dad would have wanted his two best friends... to become killers. Besides, dead, the truth dies with him. Alive, you're free.
I know.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What? Come and live with you?
Expelliarmus!
Come on.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sirius!
Sirius! No. Sirius! Expecto Patronum!
I saw my dad.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"He sent the dementors away. I saw him across the lake.
You mean they're gonna kill him?
It's true. Sirius is innocent.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What just happened? Where's Ron?
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
Hermione! Hermione! Hermione, wait. Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"That's us.
This is not normal.
You mean we've gone back in time?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Good punch.
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Here they come. I'd better hurry.
That's Pettigrew.
He betrayed my parents. You don't expect me to sit here.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Are you mad?
Ow!
Ow! That hurt!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What?
Get away. Get off.
This way.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Come on. This way. This way, now. Now what?
How?
And now we wait.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yeah. Hermione?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius... I did see someone. That someone made the dementors go away.
It was my dad. My dad conjured the Patronus.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You see Sirius talking to me there? He's asking me to come live with him.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'. It'll just be me and him. We could live in the country... someplace you can see the sky. I think he'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Let's go! What are you doing?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Thanks. Great! Now he's coming for us.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night. Sirius! Come on!
Don't worry. My dad will come. He'll conjure the Patronus. Any minute now! Right there! You'll see!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Don't worry, he will! He will come! Sirius.
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me! I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time because... well, I had already done it. Does that make sense?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I want to go with you.
But you're innocent.
My mother's eyes.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"He's free. We did it.
I don't know. Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?
You've been sacked.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Resigned? Why?
But Dumbledore...
None of it made any difference. Pettigrew escaped.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What are you talking about?
For me? But who sent it?
Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Last night.
Where are we actually going?
Yes sir. This way.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Pleasure to meet you too sir.
Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?
What's a 'portkey'?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Thanks.
See ya later Cedric.
I love magic.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
What is that?
Crime?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What crime?
Those people tonight, in the masks... they're his too aren't they? they're his followers.
There was a man. Before. There.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I dunno. I didn't see his face.
It's alright I'll get it.
Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'm fine.
Well there's something you don't see every day.
I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yeah well rather you than me.
No sir.
No sir.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yes sir.
Let you know what?
I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't want eternal glory I just wanna be.. Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just did ok.
It's a broomcupboard.
Oh, no.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'm fourteen.
I dunno I haven't really thought about it.
Fourteen.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No I didn't enter.
Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past.
Sirius?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sirius?! How...
No!
I dunno.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.
He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right?
What are you saying?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
I'm not ready for this Sirius.
Someone's coming!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Who says I was talking to anyone.
Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time.
Neville! You're doing it again!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Magical water plants of the highland Lochs?
Is that right? Well.... what?
Well you can tell Ronald...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going?
What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?
Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ron was here?
No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.
Thanks.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Excuse me..
Can I have a word?
Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of us.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yes.
Don't worry about it.
You're a right foul git you know that?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I know so.
Yeah. Stay away from me.
I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd...
Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer.
But I'm not allowed a broom.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yeah.
Battle a dragon.
The horntail...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Nothing.
Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it?
What the bloody hell was that?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Caught on have you. Took you long enough.
Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.
Hagrid warned me about the dragons.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental.
Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?
Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them...
I think I'd take the dragon right now.
But then again he can take himself.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Agreed.
Cho!
Ok thanks. Cho?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Um.  I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me?
Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What happened to you?
What did she say?
Don't be silly.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What did you do then?
Hey!
My dress robes.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Well I expect yours are more traditional.
Leave it alone.
Who?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
Ready professor?
No.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yeah she does.
What?
Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What's that supposed to mean?
Cedric.
Spectacular.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
I must be out of my mind.
Myrtle!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water?
Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?
Come seek us where our voices sound.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"An hour long you'll have to look.
Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?
Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You're sure about this Neville.
For an hour.
Most likely?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You're telling me this now? You must be joking.
Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?
Do I?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But she's my friend too!
Hermione
I finished last Hermione.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Mr Crouch?
I can come back later Professor.
Agh!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Professor?
Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?
It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you?
Yes sir.
Bubble juice sir?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I haven't stolen anything.
Fleur? Fleur!
No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"He's bewitched!
For a moment so did I.
Some game.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Together, on three. One, two, three!
Yeah, you?
I've been here before.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now!
Get back to the cup!
Cedric!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Don't touch him.
Have it your way.
He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Not so much now.
The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it.
Who?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.
Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor.
It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"That's Moody, but then who's...?
Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.
No I don't think so.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yes.
Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums.
What?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you...
Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!
Not so brave now, are you Duddykins? Now tell your little friends to go away.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Don't you ever speak about that again. You understand?
I said, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? !
Quiet!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Dudley! Run!
Come on! They break into a run. A dementor drifts into the alleyway in front of them. Skidding to a stop, Harry turns around, to find the other dementor cutting off the way back.
Dudley, no!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Lumos!
""Expecto Patronum!'
""Expecto Patronum! '",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Dementors.
No.
We were attacked.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"They're evil. If they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through your mouth.
You can't give a Dementor the 'ol one-two.'
Because I used magic to save his",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Lumos!
What are you doing here?
How'd he know? It just happened!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What's been going on? What's Lord Vol-
How are we getting there?
Uh, is that very likely?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Expecto--!
No!
But I can help!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Was that your--?
But...why here?
Mrs. Weasley!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Right.
So, why's he keeping me in the dark?
Didn't you bother asking?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"So I get to spend the summer with the Dursleys while you two are here.
You've still been here!
What's been going on?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What's this Order everyone's talking about?
Why?
Okay.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'm not really hungry. I think I'll go to bed.
I wanted to, but I didn't think you'd tell me anything.
Where's Voldemort? What's he doing?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"How?
And what's his plan?
And you're stopping him from gaining followers?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But...why?
But you're telling people, right?
What?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What kind of weapon?
No, my scar kept hurting.
Yeah...nerves...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Thanks, Hermione.
Bye.
Department of Mysteries?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I've been there before...
Er...sorry.
Yes.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yes, but-
Yes, but-
Yes.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But I did it because of the Dementors!
My cousin and I were attacked by Dementors. That's why I had to use the Patronus, to drive them away.
I think so, yeah.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Er...is Percy mad at you?
What are you doing here?
If he wanted to talk to the Minister, why down here?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger.
My parents.
I miss them, Sirius...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Why'd they have to die, Sirius, why?
Thanks.
Who..who was that?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'm sure. Nothing.
So...congratulations Ron, Hermione...
Yes, do go enjoy yourselves.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What is that?
Yes it is, it's right there!
Er...you are?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Well, thanks Luna.
Hagrid's cabin looks deserted.
Yeah, could be.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What?
Why?
What did I do?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Where'd she get that from?
No one believes me, Hedwig. No one...
I'm alone...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sorry, Professor...
What good's theory in the real world?
What about Lord Voldemort?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"It-is-NOT-a-LIE!
So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead? Or are you calling me a murderer?
It was MURDER! I saw it happen!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yeah, talk to somebody who cares.
Yeah. But she called me a liar!
Yes, Professor.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Oh! Sorry...
I'll never get out of it, Angelina.
Later, I've got detention.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Thanks.
There's no ink.
No, I haven't.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"She is. But the quill has some sort of spell on it. It uses blood for ink.
No, I'm telling anyone.
No!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I don't need his help. I don't need anyone's help.
I've asked Sirius about it.
Don't worry, Hermione, I wrote it in code. Anyway, I figured I need to tell someone about Umbridge. My scar hurt again last night in detention.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?
Yeah, but Dumbledore didn't have a choice, did he? She'd been sent here by the Ministry.
Er...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Where are we going, Hermione?
Hermione, what's going on?
You mean about us teaching ourselves?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hey, Neville.
Uh...same to you, Luna.
That's the first time you've said his name.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"It's okay, Hermione.
I believe Voldemort's back because I fought him last year. Dumbledore's already told the school that. If you didn't believe him you won't believe anyone.
Me?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Uh...well, yeah, I did.
That might work. I'll look into that.
Yeah.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What's she done now?
""By order of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor: All student organizations, societies, teams, groups, and clubs are henceforth disbanded. Permission to reform must be approved by High Inquisitor Umbridge. No student organization can exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor. Any student found to be a part of an illegal organization will be expelled immediately.""
Not only that, but what about the",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"This isn't a coincidence.
She knows.
Look, we don't know how many people could have overheard our meeting and told her.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What would we do without you, Hermione?
Hedwig!
It's Hedwig. I think she's been attacked.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"London.
Yes, Professor.
Dobby! What are you doing here?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What is it, Dobby.
Don't worry about it, Dobby. But I don't think you can help me.
Actually, there is something you can do, Dobby.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor Umbridge.
That's brilliant, Dobby!
Better not, Dobby. School is pretty intense right now. We'll do it ina few months, before the holidays.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Just ignore them, Ron!
Malfoy provoked us.
Ban us...for life.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You've--!
You can't!
If you quit, we'll be out four players!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hagrid, what happened to you?
We know you were looking for giants, Hagrid. Dumbledore said so last year.
So what did you do when you found them?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Glad to see all of you could find this place all right.
Loads of Defense Against the Dark Arts equipment. Hopefully we'll be able to get to all of it before the end of term.
Besides, it works. I used it against You-Know-Who last June. It saved my life.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Right. Well, let's split into pairs and give it a go.
Well done, Neville!
Look here, you lot! Neville's really got the hang of this one.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Never forget this spell, Neville. It could save your live some day.
Okay, everyone. We've done a lot today, and I've seen some great improvement. That's it for now. We'll meet back here, same time next week!
Mr. Weasley's been attacked!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No, I saw it happen! I...I was there...
Oh. Uh...I was the snake. I saw it from the snake's perspective.
Yes!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What's that, Professor?
Voldemort can read minds?
So he could read our minds right now?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But hasn't it helped so far? I mean, it saved Mr. Weasley's life, didn't it?
What are you going to do?
No!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I've been there before...
I've just realized...
What's in the Department of Mysteries, sir?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"That corridor, I've been dreaming about it for months...it leads to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure of it.
It's got to be.
Probably. Mr. Weasley was probably there when he was attacked, too. That must be what the Order's guarding!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"They're all Death Eaters!
Voldemort.
Professor, no!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'm so sorry, Professor!
Are you sure you can't? Hagrid said it was important.
Could you tell us what it is, Hagrid, please?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yeah.
No!
I--sorry!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No, of course not!
No--no, I've done all I can.
Voldemort! He's got Sirius! In the Department of Mysteries!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I just saw it.
How're we going to get there?
We've got to do something!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I won't let Sirius die!
Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there!
There isn't anyone else, Hermione! Everyone from the Order is gone!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No, there isn't!
How?
That's all we'll need.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Grimmauld Place!
Sirius! Lupin? Hello?
Kreacher, where's Sirius?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You know where he is, don't you?
It's none of your business.
He's got Padfoot at the place it's hidden!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You sent the Dementors?
Hermione, no!
I would rather die!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Great plan, Hermione.
We've got no brooms.
What are those?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"All right, then. Get on one, and we'll be off.
All right, come on.
Where is everyone?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed.
This is it. Come on.
Stay close.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I don't understand. In my dream,
Yeah. I'll know the way when I see it.
Who's there?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sirius?
Does anyone else hear that?
Sirius...yeah...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Alohomora!
Whatever's in there, the Ministry sure doesn't want anyone getting to it.
This is it! Come on!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"This is it. This is where Sirius is!
He's in here somewhere.
What's my name doing here?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Why not?
It's got my name on it!
Where's Sirius?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What prophesy?
Go ahead.
Come and find out!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You even try to take her and I'll smash this thing.
So, what kind of prophesy are we talking about here?
Not really. How come Voldemort wants it?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hey, did you know Voldemort's a half-blood too?
What's so special about this
What?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"So he used me to do his dirty work, did he?
Now!
Where'd the rest go?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Stupify!
Stupify!
Ron!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Pretificus Totalus!
Hermione!
Please don't be dead, please don't be dead... He shakes her.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Can we carry her?
I don't know...
What happened.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"We need to get out of here. Luna, can you help Ginny?
Let my friends go and I will.
Stop, Neville!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Are you all right?
You come with us!
Protego!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No...no...no....
I'LL KILL you!!
Stupify!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Crucio!
Can't. It got smashed by accident!
How's Voldemort going to like that? You've failed him, and he's not very forgiving, is he?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"He can't hear you from here, you know!
Look out!
Professor!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No you don't!
You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know!
I don't care! I don't care!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Let me out.
You can't keep me in here!
I already know all this.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Well, yeah, I did...
But Snape stopped giving me lessons.
He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort—-",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side...
I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the connection.
But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Why?
What?
Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!
Sirius hated him.
Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"She never loved me.
I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me.
I don't understand, Professor.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Professor, why am I so important to
Sir, it got smashed.
I'm not sure I understand all that, sir...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"And...it means me?
So it's not necessarily me, sir?
What if he chose wrong?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Why didn't he wait? Why attack when we were babies?
But I don't have any special powers.
What is it, sir?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"One of us has to kill the other...in the end.
Hey, Nick.
Oh. Thanks.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Nick, I was wondering about something?
Expecting what?
I expect so...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Why?
How are you?
Better.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I've got something to tell you. Something important.
But not right now. I'm not ready.
Do you need any help looking?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Isn't it?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
That even though we've got a fight ahead of us we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
Something worth fighting for",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Oh.  Um.  No one.  Bit of a tosser.
Really.
Hey.  I was wondering...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things.
I just Apparated, didn't I?
Can't imagine why...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"After all these years, I just sort of roll with it, sir.
My mother's eyes, yeah.
One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sir, exactly what was that all --
It's alright, sir.  I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse --
But, sir.  What about Hedwig?  And there's my trunk --",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sir?
Really.
Didn't know. Dumbledore.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"When'd you get here?
Oh come on...
But we're talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be safer?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Rubbish.  He's only -- what?
Amazing.
Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Reckon he's right...
Good.  Bad.  Speaking of which...
Dunno.  Let's get closer.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I don't know.  I'm turned around.
What just happened?
Don't you see, it was a ceremony. An initiation.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"It's happened.  He's one of them.
So what's he doing in Borgin and Burke's?  Browsing for furniture?
Look.  His father's a Death Eater. It only makes sense.  Besides, Hermione saw it.  With her own eyes.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I need some air.
Luna.  How'd you...?
Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I am your friend, Luna.
Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years.
Have you ever fixed one?  A nose.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What the hell.  Give it a go.
Well?  How do I look?
Brilliant.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Later.  What've I missed?
Thanks...
This can't be good.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Well, you see, I've got an open period this morning, Professor --
It is.  Or was.  But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my
Really?  Well... brilliant.  I'll head there straight away.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Um, sorry, sir, but I haven't got my book yet -- nor's Ron.  You see --
Crush it.  Don't cut it.
No.  Really --",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Fine, sir.
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.
Definitely.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sir?
No!  I mean... she's brilliant. And we're friends.  But... no.
Did you know, sir?  Then?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you, sir?
You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.
Do you want me to let him?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"All right!  Queue up!  Excuse me...
Thanks.  All right.  This morning I'll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths.  But know this:  Just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year.  Is that clear?
All right.  Cormac.  Ron.  It's down to you two for Keeper.  We'll decide it with a shootout. Demelza, you'll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac.  Ginny, you'll take on Ron.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Quiet!  I'm Captain.  We do it my way.  Now line up.  On three. One.  Two... Three!
C'mon, Ron...
Ever heard of this spell?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No.
It's... old.  The binding is fragile.
I didn't say I wasn't curious. And, by the way, I don't sleep with it.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"The library.
And?
Good.  That settles it then.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Who's up for a Butterbeer?
No.  Over here.
No, no.  Sit next to me.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hello, sir.  Wonderful to see you.
So what brings you here, sir?
I'd consider it an honor, sir.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.
Dunno.  But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn't ask.
There's no time!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"She was cursed, wasn't she?  I know Katie.  Off the Quidditch pitch she wouldn't hurt a fly.  If she was bringing that to someone, she wasn't doing it knowingly.
It was Malfoy.
I... just... know.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What does she see in him?
You called him a slick git not five hours ago.
I suppose.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I don't know.  She's smart. Funny.  Attractive...
You know.  She's... got nice skin.
Well, no.  I mean... I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I've never really thought about it.  But I suppose, yeah.  Very nice.
I think I'll be going to sleep now.
What?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass.
I think I'll be going.
The shelf, sir?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I don't really know how to answer that, sir.
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?
You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle.  You were his teacher.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What was he like?
I'm sorry, sir.  Forgive me.  He killed my parents, you see...
Have it your way.  Juice?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Dunno what you're talking about.
Yep.  Apparently it's his lucky day.
Yeah.  I suppose I could've just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ah.  Well... they're really good.
It feels like this.
Have you?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we'd really like... maybe we'd go together.  As friends.
So who are you taking?
Really...?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But I am the Chosen One.
Okay.  Kidding.  I'll just ask someone I like.  Someone cool.
Neville...?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What're you doing?
And what's happened to you?
Cormac!  That's who you invited!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I think she went to powder her nose.
Dragon balls.
I think I should rejoin the party, sir.  My date...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"A message...?
Traveling?  Where?
Positive.  Why?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.
Lovely.
I'll take your word for it.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"So what happens?  If you break an Unbreakable Vow?
Draco's plotting something, I know it, something to do with Voldemort.  He's been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help.
I know it sounds mad --",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"That's not what it sounded like.
But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He's said it himself --
I'm not --",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"It's good.
Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?
Did you get my owl?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Go on.
A Vanishing Cabinet?
What happened to it?  The one at Borgin & Burkes?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Soon.
I know who I am, Hermione, alright?
If Dumbledore's traveling places, it's news to the Ministry.  But get this:  that night at Borgin & Burkes?  It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You tell me.
Who could tell the difference?
I don't understand -- what happened?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But why would he tamper with his own memory?
Why?
I don't know him that well, sir --",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.
Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in the library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading.  Something about a bit of rare magic...
I'm not sure... That is, I don't recall the name... exactly.  But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yes, well, we don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.  What I mean to say is, he's not like you.  He might... misunderstand.
Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir?  When he came asking questions.
Sir --",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Nice.
Hermione.  I think Malfoy's leaving the castle.
I've seen it.  Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the Map.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"The Map is never wrong.
Divine.  Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?
Or twenty.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Really?  Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you.
Excuse me?
Well... Brilliant.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Bloody well hope so.  She's been snogging you for three months.
Who're you talking about?
Okay.  Very funny.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What the hell was that for?
Okay!  Fine!  You're in love with her!  Have you ever actually met her!
Ron, these chocolates, they're -- C'mon.  I'm going to introduce you to Romilda Vane.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Devastatingly handsome.
Sir.  I'm sorry.  I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely --
I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'm sorry, sir.  About the other day.  Our... misunderstanding.
I mean, I'm sure you're tired of it, after all these years.  The questions.  About... Voldemort.
Yes, sir.  It's just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.  It seemed sensible.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Love potion.
Ron!  Ron!!!  Professor, help him!
Professor!  Do something!!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"He's choking!!
Breathe!  C'mon, Ron, don't be a prat.  Breathe!  BREATHE!
How are you, Katie?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sectumsempra!
The Room of Requirement...
Who showed you this?  First.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What?
Oh.  Yeah.
Say that again.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Excellent.  Really excellent.
Right.  I'm going down to Hagrid's.
No.  I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's.  I feel like it's the place to be tonight, know what I mean?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Trust me.  I know what I'm doing. Or at least Felix does.
Sorry, sir.  I should've announced myself.  Cleared my throat. Coughed.  You probably feared I was Madam Sprout.
Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around.  The jumping when you saw me.  By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they're quite valuable, aren't they?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out.
Through the front doors, sir.  I'm off to Hagrid's, you see.  He's a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit.  So if you don't mind, I'll be going.
Sir?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Well, then by all means come along, sir.
That would be counterproductive, sir.
No idea.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"A dead one, I think, sir.
Not to mention the pincers.
Through the front doors.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Oh yeah.
Do you know why I survived?  The night I got this.
Because of her.  Because she sacrificed herself.  Because she refused to step aside.  Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'm not afraid of the name, Professor.  And I'm not afraid of him.  And you shouldn't be either. She didn't just die for me that night.  She died for you too.  She died for everyone who's ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a Death Eater waited on their doorstep.
Professor.  I'm going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at.  It's true.  I am the Chosen One.
Only I can kill him.  But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told him.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Be brave, Professor.  Be brave like my mother.  Otherwise you disgrace her.  Otherwise she died for nothing.  Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever.
Sir --
Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir?  In making a Horcrux?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Seven.  He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number.  But... what are they exactly?
Tom Riddle's diary --
And the ring...?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"... even more difficult to destroy. But if you could find them all. If you did destroy each Horcrux...
But how would you find them?  They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they...
It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?  When you leave the school.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?
It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map.
He was going to the Room of Requirement.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"But I'm telling you.  I saw it --
What if there are two?  Vanishing cabinets.
I don't know...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I don't need luck.  I'll be with Dumbledore.
You look the same to me, sir.
Yes, sir.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"My word.
Sir, I thought one couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts.
It's there, isn't it?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sir!
You should've let me, sir.
We couldn't, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Accio Horcrux!
Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis?
Professor... there are bodies in this lake.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?
Why can't I drink it, sir?
Professor?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Professor?  Can you hear me?
You... you can't stop, Professor. You've got to keep drinking.  Like you said.  Remember.
It will, sir.  It'll stop.  But only if you drink...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What?
No...
One more.  Just one more.  And then -- I promise... I'll do what you say.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I promise.
You did it, sir.  Look --
I'm trying, sir.  I'm --",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Don't worry, sir.  We're nearly there.
We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey --
All right.  Okay.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sir, are you... praying?
Cruciatus!
Incacerata!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Impedimenta!
Fight!  Fight back, you coward!
Sectumsempra!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hagrid... HAGRID!
Hagrid!  You alright?
Hagrid, Dumbledore --",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Do you think he would've done it. Draco?
No.  He was lowering his wand.  In the end, it was Snape.  It was always Snape.  And I did nothing...
Yeah, strange.  Only... it's not. It's a fake.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Go on.  Open it.
Dunno.  But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.  Which means, it was a waste.  All of it.
I'm not coming back, Hermione.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I have to finish what Dumbledore started. I'm not sure where that will lead me... but I'll let you and Ron konw where I am -- when I can.
Yeah.  I do.  But do me a favor. When I'm around?  Keep the snogging to a minimum.
Funny, he says the same about you.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You're brilliant.  You both are.
I don’t know. I never realised how beautiful this place was.
Time for the teary farewell.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"They'll torture you.  Even Dudley. If they think you know where I'm going, they'll stop at noth--
Do you have any?  Magic?
Absolutely not.  Besides, I'm just a waste of space.  Isn't that right, Vernon?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Well... thanks.
See you, Big D.
Good riddance.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister, Kingsley.
The Trace?
The real one...?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No!  Absolutely not!
If you think I'm going to let people risk their lives for me --
This is different.  Taking that. Becoming me -- no.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Blimey, Hermione!
Yes?
Here.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hagrid!  We've got to help the others!
What was that?
Hagrid... HAGRID...!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Is no one back yet?
Are you mad...?
A grindylow!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Who did this to him?
Hedwig -- I think.  She was trying to protect me --
I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room. Understood?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No one else is going to die.  Not for me.
Come with me.  Now.
Wedding?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I don't care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have to start searching for the Horcruxes.  It's the only chance we have to beat him.  And the longer we wait the stronger he gets.
Yes.
Dumbledore didn't want anyone to know what it is we're doing.  If I tell you, I'd be betraying him.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Maybe that's the best reason to have it.  Because of everything that's going on.
To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?
And this would be...?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What's this all about?
No idea.
That's it then?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Excuse me?
You'll forgive me, Minister.  But it's a little hard to tell the difference these days.
You mean -- But that's brilliant -- I... don't know what to say.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No, 'course not.  How are you, Luna?
Nice to meet you, sir.
Sir?  May I sit down?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir.  I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?
I never even knew he had a brother, sir.
Sir, I was wondering if you'd had much contact with him before he died.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Strange, sir?
Could you tell me from where they'd come, sir?
Just curious.  I was... close to Professor Dumbledore.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Who are you talking about?
Who?
Oh, right.  Slipped my mind...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Godric's Hollow?  Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?
Excuse me?  You don't mean to say Dumbledore lived there too?
Do you reckon everyone's alright at the wedding?  Maybe we should --",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Same.
My rucksack.  With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow --
You're joking.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Down!
Stupefy!
Lock the door, get the lights.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"This one's name is Rowle.  He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.
It's better we wipe their memories.  We kill them, they'll know we were here.
How is it they knew we were there?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hermione.  I appreciate the thought -- honestly.  But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...
I have an idea.
Mad-Eye...?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Lumos.
Yeah.  They knew her.  She wrote A History of Magic, you know.
I'm thinking maybe we should go talk to her.  She still lives in Godric's Hollow.  I'm thinking maybe she could help us.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this... I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it...
Stop!  I order you!
Been spying on us, have you?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ever seen this before?
Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me.  Which means I own you too.
That's right.  But there were two, weren't there?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Where's the other one?
Answer her.
How do you mean?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Where is it now?  Did someone take it, Kreacher?
Who, Kreacher?  Who was it?
Find him.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You mean... it remembers me?
When you turned this place over -- don't deny it! -- you found a locket, am I right?
Who was she?  This witch?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"It gets really tricky.
This is completely mental.
I'm nobody.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Apparently so.
Are those...?
The Ministry must be hiring young these days.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice Potion would last, Hermione?
Ron.  You don't have a wife.
Look, we'll go with you --",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ron's been coming here since he was two years old.  It's us you should be worrying about.
I say if we don't locate Umbridge within the hour, we go find Ron and come back another day.  Deal?
Accio locket.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Ron, it's me.
She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge --
Arthur!  You know you're being tracked, don't you?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No, Arthur.  It's a fact.  They're watching you.
I'll tell you later.  Let's find Hermione.
It's here...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You're lying.  And one mustn't tell lies, Dolores... Stupefy!
Expecto PATRONUM!
Accio Dittany.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hermione.  His arm --
What happened?  I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place.
Don't be stupid.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What're you doing?
Tent?  Where am I supposed to find --
They're great.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No problem.
How bad is he?
Dumbledore had a theory.  He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made out of random objects.  And he felt they wouldn't be hidden randomly either.  We know of three so far.  The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to Tom Riddle's grandfather.  The diary, which belonged to Tom himself. And this, which -- again, according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"How d'you know?
I know.  I felt it too. It's... it's like it's ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it's --
That's why we're going to kill it.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Dissendium!
Expulso!
We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No.
It's not a candle I can blow out, Hermione.  It always burns, even if it's just a flicker.  Can you understand that?
He's found him.  Vol--",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You-Know-Who.  He's found Gregorovitch --
Yes.  How'd you know?
You-Know-Who wants something Gregorovitch once had -- dunno what.  But he's desperate to have it.  It's as if his life depends on it.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Well it sets my teeth on edge. What's he expecting to hear?  Good news?
And what gets you through the day?
How long before he can travel?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You're not doing enough.
Loads.
Snatchers.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Good to know your enchantments work.
We have to leave.  We're not safe here.
Then we'll go by foot.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"We're all hungry.
It'll be dark soon.  We need to find a place to sleep.
My turn.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Maybe you could tell me now.
Brilliant.
O-kay.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"With a basilisk fang.  If you tell me you've got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours --
It only takes in that which makes it stronger...
... it can destroy Horcruxes.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You're brilliant, Hermione. Truly.
There's only one problem...
What's the problem?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Look, don't be shy.  If you've got something to say, spit it out.
I thought you knew what you signed up for.
I don't understand.  What part of this isn't living up to your expectations?  Did you think we'd be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you'd be back to Mummy by Christmas?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I've told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven't noticed, we've found a Horcrux!
Yeah, he would.  D'you think I haven't noticed the two of you whispering behind my back?  D'you think I haven't guessed what you were thinking?
You think I don't listen!  You think I don't know what it's like --",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Go then.  But leave that.
Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...
You were right.  It's like you said.  Snitches have flesh memories.  But I didn't catch my first Snitch with my hand.  I almost swallowed it.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What do you reckon it means?
Luna's dad was wearing that, at Ron- At Bill and Fleur's wedding.
Around his neck.  Like an amulet. I didn't think much of it at the time.  You know Luna -- she's always got some mad thing or the other she's carrying around.  I just figured it ran in the family.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hermione, I've been thinking.  I -- I want to go to Godric's Hollow. It's where I was born, it's where my parents died --
But it means something to him too, Hermione.  You-Know-Who nearly died there.  Wouldn't that be just the kind of place he'd hide a Horcrux?
Godric's Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean, 'course it is.  Obvious, isn't it?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might've popped open.
Hermione...
No.  This is where I was born. I'm not returning as someone else.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Do you think they'd be in there? My mum and dad?
Is it -- ?
No.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Happy Christmas, Hermione.
Yeah.
C'mon.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"We look like ordinary Muggles.
Relax.  This is right.  I know it.
This is where they died, Hermione. This is where he murdered them.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You're Bathilda, aren't you?
Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. Besides, she's barely knee-high to a house-elf.  I think we can overpower her if it turns ugly.
She's gaga, remember?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Here.  Let me do that.
Miss Bagshot?  Who is this man?
His name.  Can you tell me his name?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"This is him, Hermione.  The one I saw in Gregorovitch's wandshop. The thief.  Miss Bagshot, who is he?
She wants us to go upstairs.
She wants me to go.  Alone.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"It's all right.  You stay here.
Lumos.
Yes.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yes.
We got away.
Are you alright?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You've outdone yourself this time.
Where are they?
Who is he, Hermione?  The thief? Did Dumbledore know him?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Well?
Tell me, Hermione.  Who is he?
Hermione, I don't need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Get to the hard part, Hermione.
And Dumbledore believed in it?
'For the Greater Good.'  What does that mean?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"We're young, Hermione.  And here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing Dumbledore supported.
Where's my wand?  I'll take the watch.
Hermione.  Where's my wand?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"It's done.
It's done.
Leave me yours.  You get back in the warm.  And give me that.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No...
Lumos! Accio Sword.
Diffindo.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hermione...
It was you!
And the doe.  That was you as well.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"My Patronus is a stag.
You didn't see anyone else?
But I reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in that pool hoping we'd find it.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"See that?  It knows.  It's afraid. Do it.
All the more reason.
Then why are you here?  Why did you come back?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open.  When it does, don't hesitate.  I don't know what's in here, but it'll put up a fight.  The bit of Riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me.
On three.  One.  Two.  Three. Take me inside...
Stab it, Ron.  Now.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Don't listen to it.
Ron.  Don't listen to it!
Ron.  Stab it!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"We were better without you, happier without you.
Ron.  It lies!  Stab it!  STAB IT!
Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a son...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Do it, Ron!  Kill it!
After you left, she cried for a week.  She's like my sister.
You've sort of made up for it tonight.  Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"That too.
Hermione!
Fine.  Actually... more than fine.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Um... I don't know?
It's a long story.
It's a long story.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Exactly how did you find us?
It?
Knew what?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Keep talking 'bout that little ball of light touching your heart -- she'll come round.
Yeah...
Engorgio.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Reducio!
Nothing.
Sorry?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Jesus.  It was there too.
Outside Gregorovitch's wand shop. on the alley wall...
Not still mad at him, are you?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Luna.
Hello, Mr. Lovegood.  I'm Harry Potter.  We met a few months back?
Would it be okay if we came in? It won't take long, sir.  I promise.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Well, sir, we need some help.
What's going on here?
Well, sir, it's about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding.  A symbol...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yes!  Exactly.  What we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it?
The what?
No.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sorry... I still don't really understand...
Which one would you choose if you could?  Of the Deathly Hallows?
The Stone.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Well, you could bring people back, couldn't you?  Mad-Eye. Dumbledore.  Sirius.  Anybody.
But I have one.  The Invisibility Cloak my father left me.
And I think I've actually held the Resurrection Stone in my hands, that night in Dumbledore's office when he showed me the ring he'd destroyed, the Horcrux.  It had a symbol on it.  Now I think it was the mark of the Hallows.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Sir?
Who took her, sir?
They've kidnapped Luna because he supported me.  He was just desperate.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"They exist.  The Hallows.
But he only wants the one, the last one.  That's what he's been looking for.
He knows where it is, You-Know- Who.  He'll have it by the end of the night.  He's found the Elder Wand.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Dudely.  Vernon Dudley.
The list is wrong.  I told you who I am --
What did you put on me?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"How long will it last?
Luna?
Help us.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Dobby? What are you doing here?
You can Apparate in and out of this room? Could you take us with you?
Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander--",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Stupefy.
Stupefy!
Hermione. You're all right. We're safe. We're all safe.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Dobby. Dobby. No, just-- Hold on. Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay? We'll fix you. Hermione will have something. In your bag. Hermione? Hermione? What is it? Help me.
I want to bury him. Properly. Without magic.
I need to talk to the goblin.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"How are you?
You probably don't remember --
Yes.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Why did you leave Gringotts?
Alone, yes. With you, no.
It's complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn't steal it.
And she never suspected?
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Then what? The goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his eyes
She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there. She kept asking you what else we'd taken. I'd bet anything there's a Horcrux there. If we find it, we can kill it. And if we kill it, we're one step closer to killing him.
I'm still working on that part.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions.
Can you identify these, sir?
And this?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Was? Isn't it still?
What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?
But you, sir? Do you believe they exist?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You're lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.
He has found it, sir.
That's all, sir. We'll leave you to get some rest now.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Then I guess I'll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir.
I reckon you should take this then.
If I can hold it, you can.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'll know. I can't explain. It's like...
No. I just know. When one's near.
In the morning.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"He'll be leaving too.
Yeah. Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I don't want you to think I --
Hogwarts?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"It's not the place you left, you
Wouldn't know you if I didn't know you.
Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Something like that. I don't know. He died before I ever got to use it. The thing is...
You'll think I'm mental, but more than once, when I've looked into it -- I think I've seen Dumbledore.
You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"C'mon. Let's do it.
Imperio.
How long before they come after us?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"What is that, Griphook?
Griphook! What is that!
Well done. Hey.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Lumos !
That's it. Up there.
Give me the sword! The real one.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"We have a deal, Griphook.
Griphook! Griphook!
Come on!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"We're dropping!
He knows.
I saw him.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I can't always help it, Hermione!
He's angry. But he's scared too. He's going to make sure the other Horcruxes are safe.
I reckon he'll do anything to stop us from finding the rest. There's more: one of them's at Hogwarts.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose.
We'll go to Hogsmeade. To Honeydukes. Take the secret passage in the cellar.
There's something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow his thoughts. Now everything feels disconnected.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"No. It's more like he's wounded. If anything, he feels more
Expecto Patronum!
You're Aberforth.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Dumbledore's brother. It's you I've been seeing -- here. It's
He's dead.
Dung had no right selling you that. It belonged to --",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's in the school. But we'll need your help getting in.
If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him, and then we can end this war once and for all. We need to get into Hogwarts tonight.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through.
Why should he...
I only care about the Dumbledore I knew. I trusted him.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I had no reason not to —-
You're drunk.
Where've you sent her?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Neville, you look...
The Carrows?
Okay. There's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle. It could help us defeat You-Know-Who.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"We don't know.
I realize it's not much to go on.
I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw. It would be small, easy to conceal, valuable. Any ideas?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Hey there. Ron smiles, about to speak, then notices Ginny's eyes have not left Harry. He frowns, speaks to Hermione.
I think I can help you out with that... -.. Harry appears.
And I'm afraid it's rather extensive.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"How dare you stand where he stood.
Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him. Tell them!
I'm a Gryffindor.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Time. As much as you can give me.
Is that possible, Professor?
I think you're right.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You, too, Professor.
Okay. But take this. That way you can find me when you get back.
Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere. Hermione nods, slips the Map in her beaded bag and she and Ron head off. Just before they turn the corner, Ron looks back, holds Harry's glance briefly... and then is",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'm a bit preoccupied right now, Luna.
We'll talk later, Luna.
Later.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Okay, Luna. Who've you got in mind?
It's you...
You're the Grey Lady, the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I'm sorry. It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena's daughter. Luna told me.
Yes. She thought you might be able to help me.
Yes! That's right --",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Wait! Please!
But I don't care about its powers! Honestly --
I don't seek it for myself! You have to believe me!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I want to destroy it.
That's what you want, isn't it, Helena? You want it destroyed.
I'll end your pain, Helena. Tell me where it is and I'll destroy it, I swear, on my mother's memory —-",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Tom Riddle --
He's lied to many people --
Thank you... -.. then turning...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Thank you... -.. then running.
Ginny! Neville! You alright?
Luna -- ?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I could ask you the same.
I remember.
What's wrong with the one you have?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Why didn't you tell her?
Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything.
No. I don't think so...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Besides, its allegiance is to me now. If you want it, you'll have to win it back. Perhaps even kill me...
Expelliarmus!
Well done. Let's find Ron and get out of here.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Split up!
No, it''ll just follow us!
Here! Take one!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!
Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul.
He does.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"It's the snake. She's the last one. The last Horcrux.
No. He'll keep her close.
I know where he is.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything.
I'm going there now.
It's... meant to be.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"There's a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes.
I think I've known for awhile.
Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it's just him. Then it will be over.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Why are you here? All of you?
Does it hurt? Dying?
I'm sorry. I didn't want any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son...",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You'll stay with me?
He won't be able to see you?
Stay close to me.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You weren't.
Sir, this, is this... I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren't you, sir?
Then... I'm dead too?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Not?
But I didn't defend myself. I let him kill me.
It's true, isn't it, sir? A bit of him lives in me, doesn't it?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"And you knew this? That's why you were certain I wouldn't die?
Professor, is that -- ?
Exactly where are we, sir?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"It looks like King's Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And without the trains.
Sir, why didn't you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows?
Sir --",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"You wanted to see Ariana again, didn't you, sir?
I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered the Forest. I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin...
I've got to go back, haven't I?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"I've got a choice?
And where would it take me?
Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"And the snake lives.
And I've nothing to kill it with.
With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Which would be, sir?
Sir, my mother's Patronus. It was a doe, wasn't it? Just like Professor Snape's. Curious, don't you think?
Professor.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?
Confringo!
The snake! We've got to kill the snake!",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Because I have something worth living for.
Confringo!
You were right.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will always fail you.
Together.
I told you: it's useless to you.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Because it answers to another.
When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But the thing is... it never belonged to Snape.
It answers to me.",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Well, it wasn't boring, was it?
Together?
There's nothing scary about thestrals. They're gentle things. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages. You/'be going in the boats, remember?",Good,3,Undead
harry potter,"Yes?
Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.
Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard. But listen, if it means so much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.",Good,3,Undead

An iguana s-such as this is...",Bad,1,Dead
quirinus quirrell,"... an essential in-gredient.
Oh. Y-yes, of course.  And the vampire b-bat...
TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!!  Thought you ought to know.",Bad,1,Dead
quirinus quirrell,"Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh.  Ahh! Hehe....
Severus...I-I thought...
W-what do you m-mean?",Bad,1,Dead
quirinus quirrell,"Yes. He does seem the type, doesn’t he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you.  And trust me, if Snape’s cloak hadn’t caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little countercurse.
I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween.",Bad,1,Dead
quirinus quirrell,"Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn’t fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again.  He rarely left me alone. But he doesn’t understand. I’m never alone, never.  Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?
Come here, Potter. Now!  Tell me... what do you see?  What is it?  What do you see?
Tell the truth! What do you see?!",Bad,1,Dead
quirinus quirrell,"Master, you are not strong enough.
Ahh! Ahh!  What is this magic?",Bad,1,Dead
boy,"It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, it’s the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet.
Ravenclaws, follow me. This way.
We're not supposed to take off, yet.",Trash,0,Trash

Stay together!",Trash,0,Trash

Very well.
Madam Lestrange.",Trash,0,Trash
goblin,"Identification.
I see. Very well. Excuse me, won't you?
Next.",Trash,0,Trash
goblin,"But... Bogrod, there have been special instructions regarding the Lestrange vault.
Yes, sir, but our instructions are very specific --",Trash,0,Trash
griphook,"Vault 687. Lamp, please.  Key please.
Vault 713.
Stand back.",Neutral,1,Undead
griphook,"I don't know.
When I was last in your vault, the sword was there. Oh, well then, perhaps it just walked out on its own then.
There is no place safer than Gringotts.",Neutral,1,Undead
griphook,"Alive.
And brought me here.
You are a very unusual wizard.",Neutral,1,Undead
griphook,"Soon the Death Eaters will control it. That was unacceptable to me.
This is a wizard's war. I take no side.
It is impossible.",Neutral,1,Undead
griphook,"How did you come by this sword?
It's complicated.
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault identical to this one, but it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer.",Neutral,1,Undead
griphook,"The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.
It was not my place to ask, nor did I desire to. There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts.
Perhaps.",Neutral,1,Undead
griphook,"I have no interest in gold.
That is my price.
I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the Sword of Gryffindor if I help you?",Neutral,1,Undead
griphook,"Good morning? Good morning? You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewy-eyed schoolgirl!
She gives us away and we might as well use that sword to slit our own throats. Understand?
They know!",Neutral,1,Undead
griphook,"They know she's an imposter! They've been warned!
I should have known --
The Thief's Downfall. Washes away all enchantments. Can be deadly.",Neutral,1,Undead
griphook,"No.
We need him!
Well done.",Neutral,1,Undead
griphook,"Go on.
We'll only have a few seconds. In other words... they'll be no do-
Ready, Bogrod?",Neutral,1,Undead
griphook,"We'll be crushed! Hurry!
I said I'd get you in. I never said anything about getting you out.
Thieves! Help! Thieves!",Neutral,1,Undead
garrick ollivander,"I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands.  Ah. Here we are.  Well, give it a wave.  Apparently not.  Perhaps this.  No, no, definitely not! No matter...  I wonder.  Curious, very curious.
I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar.
Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great.",Good,1,Undead
garrick ollivander,"No!  No!  I believed a different wand would work, I swear!
But it makes no sense...
No!  There must be a way!  I'll think of something else!",Good,1,Undead
garrick ollivander,"There's no way out of here. We've tried everything. It's enchanted.
Forgive me if I don't get up.
Anything, m'boy, anything.",Good,1,Undead
garrick ollivander,"Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange.
Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has changed.",Good,1,Undead
garrick ollivander,"The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.
There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist --
He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There's no guarantee he will find it --",Good,1,Undead
garrick ollivander,"He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true, what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance.",Good,1,Undead

Come on. Platform 9¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first.
Fred, you next.",Good,1,Undead
molly weasley,"Oh, I'm sorry, George.
How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.  Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you dear. Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could have died! You could have been seen! Of course, I don't blame you, Harry dear.",Good,1,Undead
molly weasley,"Well, you'd best hope that I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are Harry. Now tuck in! That's it. There we go.
Yes dear. It was on the cat.
Morning Arthur!",Good,1,Undead
molly weasley,"This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
Arthur!
Well, that'll be Errol with the post. Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please?",Good,1,Undead
molly weasley,"Oh, no.
We'll manage. There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley.
Right. Here we are Harry, you go first dear.",Good,1,Undead
molly weasley,"Oh, well you go first Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes. In you go… That's it.
You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That's it, mind your head. That's right. Now take your Floo powder. That's it, very good. Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly.
What did he say, dear?",Good,1,Undead
molly weasley,"I thought he did.
Oh, Harry! Thank goodness! We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far…
Ah! Here he is!",Good,1,Undead
molly weasley,"Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That's it, Ron.
The train will be leaving any moment!
Okay.",Good,1,Undead

Harry.
Good to see you, dear.",Good,1,Undead

Yes? All of your books?
All of your clothes?",Good,1,Undead

Quick. Quick. Ron, Ron! Oh, for goodness' sake! Don't lose him!
Hello, Harry dear.",Good,1,Undead

Harry, dear, go on upstairs-— quietly, if you please. They're all up there.
You can come down now, the meeting's over.",Good,1,Undead
molly weasley,"Arthur-
And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young--
It's not your decision!",Good,1,Undead
molly weasley,"He's not an adult either!
I only have Harry's best interests at heart.
Who else does he have, then?",Good,1,Undead
molly weasley,"Morning, dear! Did you have a good sleep?
Good luck, Harry!
You're worse than Fred and George.",Good,1,Undead
molly weasley,"Harry who?
I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?
I seriously doubt that.",Good,1,Undead
molly weasley,"But why didn't you tell us you were coming?
That man.  But then, what would we do without him?  Ron!
Eat up, eat up, everyone!  There's more to come!",Good,1,Undead
molly weasley,"You're sure you won't stay?
Remus...?
Harry!  Hagrid!  What happened?! Have you seen the others?",Good,1,Undead
molly weasley,"Well, thank goodness you two are all right.
My boy!  My darling boy!  What've they done to you?!
Back off, boys! She's mine!  You will never touch my chiidren again!",Good,1,Undead
george weasley,"He's not Fred, I am!
We got Potter! We got Potter!
Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"But they'll turn up in a month or two!
Do you like yours, Ron?  Ron?
Go, go, go, go!",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Right!
Yeah, Mum would never know.
Morning, Dad.",Good,2,Undead

Not flashing that clipping again are you Ron?
': No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The Cook. The bloke who fixed the toilet. And that wizard from Belgium.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Yeah, come on Ron, let's walk you off the astronomy tower and see what you look like.
But not clever enough. Besides, we've got a better way.
We know. Don't worry. We'll get you there. We'll show you a quicker way. If you pipe down.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Now, Harry.
Come and join the big boys.
It's a wrench giving it to you believe me. But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
We owe them so much.
In his study.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Does that a lot.
Everyone.
What they're doing.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Of every day.
Now listen, there are seven secret passageways... out of the castle. We'd recommend
This one.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"It'll lead you straight to Honeyduke's seller.
Oh and Harry don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
Mischief managed. Otherwise, anyone can read it.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Did not.
It's a portkey.
Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Feet off the table.
Come on!
Here come the Bulgarians!",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Krum!!!
Yes!
Viktor I love you! Viktor I do!",Good,2,Undead

That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!
Thank you thank you, well lads we've done it.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"That's why it's so brilliant.
Ready Fred?
You said..",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"We knew you wouldn't die Harry.
Or an arm.
Never.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Well done 'moral fibre'.
Right you are, Fred.
Dumbledore believes he is.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Might be able to.
Time we did some real damage to this place.
Unless they spread, in which case, I'd get out of the castle for a while.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"And now, we've got to go!
You know, I don't think we are.
Completely, Fred.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Definitely.
Accio brooms!
Yeah, don't bother writing.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Step up!  Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancy...
And just in time for school...",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Into the cauldron, handsome.
Pocket that and you'll pay in more than Galleons, my friend.
Bloody urchins.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Yes, they do really work.
Five Galleons.
Five Galleons.",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Dead ugly.
Yeah, imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as scrawny, specky gits forever.
Wow -- we're identical!",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Don't have something a bit more sporty, do you?
Saint-like.
Saint-like... You see, I'm holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?",Good,2,Undead
george weasley,"Reckon I'm still better-looking than you.  Better-looking than Bill, that's for sure.
Morning.
Bloody hell, what's the Minister of Magic doing here?",Good,2,Undead
fred weasley,"Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother.
I'm only joking. I am Fred.
We got Potter! We got Potter!",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!
Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally...
Come on.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Right.
Come on. Okay, come on. Shh! Shh! Ok, come on. Shh! Come on.
Morning, Dad.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Oh, it…
This lot won't come cheap, Mum. The spell books alone are very expensive.
And not to mention, they're dead scared that Harry'll Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Not flashing that clipping again are you Ron?
': No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The Cook. The bloke who fixed the toilet. And that wizard from Belgium.
Peaky? What do you expect? He fell over 100 feet.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"You gave us a right good scare there, mate.
Clever, Harry.
We know. Don't worry. We'll get you there. We'll show you a quicker way. If you pipe down.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Oh. Bless him.
Come and join the big boys.
What's this rubbish? he says. That there it's the secret to our success.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"George, if you will.
Dumbledore.
Pacing.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Everyone.
Where they are.
Every minute.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Knicked it from Filch's office, of course. First year.
This one.
The One-Eyed Witch passageway.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"You best hurry. Filch is heading this way.
Mischief managed. Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Did not.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"That isn't just any old manky boot mate.
Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.
Feet off the table.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"It's the Irish!
Krum!!!
Viktor I love you! Viktor I do!",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
Sounds like the irish have got their pride on.
Wicked.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Cooked it up just this morning.
Oh yeah? And why's that Granger.
So?",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Ready George?
Lose a leg.
Pack it in altogether.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosey sods listening in.
Try saying that five times faster.
Never.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"All that moral fibre eh?
George, remember that concept. Vomiting Toilet.
Hear, hear!",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Can't forget that he saved the Sorcerer's Stone from You-Know-Who in his first year.
Just give us a few seconds.
It's been too quiet around here",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Right. You've got ten minutes to get to Umbridge's office. And whatever you do, stay away from the Astronomy Tower for the next couple of hours.
That was worth it!
Thank you for playing, one and all.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Fairly amusing, yeah.
This was never your school! Hogwarts is Dumbledore's school!
George, I think we've outgrown full- time education. Wouldn't you agree?",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Time to enter the real world?
Accio brooms!
We won't be seeing you.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Be sure to visit us at our new premises on Diagon Alley!
Step up!  Step up!
Nosebleed Nougats...",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Puking Pastilles!
Into the cauldron, handsome.
What'd you think, Harry?",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"We've got eyes in the back of our heads.
A real money spinner that.
Handy if you need to make a quick escape.  Hello, ladies!",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own.
Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?
Aren't they now.  Pygmy Puffs. Can't breed them fast enough.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Five Galleons.
Five Galleons.
Ten Galleons.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Wasn't always this handsome.
Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.
Have a lot of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye?",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Just trying to defuse the tension.
Wow -- we're identical!
Yes, don't fancy this color at all.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"How do you feel, Georgie?
Come again?
With the whole wide world of ear- related humor at your disposal, you go for holey?  Pathetic.",Good,2,Dead
fred weasley,"Brilliant!
Nice night for it!",Good,2,Dead
ginny weasley,"Good luck.
Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
Leave him alone.",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didn't mean to! Riddle made me, and… Harry, you're hurt!
The Fat Lady! She's gone!
Think you're in love Ron?",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.
Someone here does. Everyone looks at her. She is staring directly at Harry.
And you fought off those dementors that attacked you this summer.",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"I think it should be Dumbledore's Army. There is excited agreement. Harry smiles at her.
We heard Harry yelling. What's up?
Anything we can do to help?",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"We can do that! Me and Luna'll guard the hallway.
What now, Harry?
The Ministry closed a half-hour ago. I expect they all went home.",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"Now where?
I think my ankle's broken. And somebody hit Ron with a weird spell...
Hedwig...?  Mum!",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"Exactly.  How'd you guess?
I'm joking, Mum.
Now you're joking.  I was only wondering when Harry got here.",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"Harry Dimpleton.  Harry Potter, of course.
Well his trunk's in the kitchen. And his owl.
Me, nosy.  Is he up there with you?",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"Harry's.  Haven't seen him, have you?  Apparently, he's wandering about the house.
Meaning?
None of your business.",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"Please.  What's a Wrackspurt?
He's covered in blood again.  Why is it he's always covered in blood?
Shut It!",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"Piss off, Cormac.  How 'bout I toss you a floater?
Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
That's what it says.  Right here. 'This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.'",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"Sorry, I'm not ordinarily late --
What's gotten into him?
Open up, you.",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"Don't trust me?
'Course 'tis.  Made them myself.
Everyone gone to bed?",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"I don't sleep these days.  So I wash my hair.  Silly, right?
Happy Christmas, Harry.
Oh my god...",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"No, Harry!  It's a trap!
'Bout time, don't you think?
You have to get rid of it.  Today.",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"Take my hand.
Over the years, if someone had a secret, if they wanted to conceal something, this is where they came.  Some of these things are almost as old as the castle itself.
Fred and George.  First year.  I hid Tom Riddle's diary here for a time.  Wish I'd left it...",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"What was that?
See, you never know what you'll find up here.
All right.  Close your eyes.  That way you can't be tempted.",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"There's something else.  Another secret of sorts.  One of mine...
That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.
Ron and Tonks should've already been back.  Dad and Fred as well.",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"Oh my God!  George!
Remus!  What're you doing!
Were you going to tell me?",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"And Ron and Hermione.  They'll not be going back to Hogwarts either?
I see.
Zip me up, will you.",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"Seems silly, doesn't it?  A wedding.  Given everything that's going on.
Harry.
Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"Ready!?
What?
Mad. The both of you.",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"I know.
It's all right. We're going to get you inside.
Don't worry. I won't leave you. I promise.",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,"Who's that?
... Hagrid's carrying?
Neville, who is that?",Good,1,Undead
ginny weasley,No... NO!,Good,1,Undead
ron weasley,"Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.
I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.
So-so it's true? I mean, do you really have the...the...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Scar...?
Wicked.
No, thanks, I'm all set.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Whoa!
They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!
It's just a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.  Watch it!  Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I got about 6 of him.
Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?  This is Scabbers, by the way, pathetic, isn't he?
Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Ahem. Sun-
No.
Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I'm...Ron Weasley.
Whoaa!
Wicked.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Mental that one, I'm telling you.
There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin.
Harry, what is it?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Ahh!
I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!
Ahh!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Look at that one, Harry!
Whew, we made it. Can you imagine the look on McGonagall's face if we were late?
That was bloody brilliant.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before-
Ah. Mail's here!
Up!!  Ooh!  Shut up, Harry.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...
Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.
Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.
I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.
Ahh!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Before the staircase moves again.
It's Filch's cat!
That's it, we're done for!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Alohomora?
Probably thinks this door's locked.
What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three!
She needs to sort out her priorities!
Wingardrium Leviosar!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.
It's Levioooosa, not Leviosaaaar.  She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!
Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes.  What?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I think the troll's left the dungeon!
Hey, pea brain!
Ew.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"What?
Wingardium Leviosa!  Cool.
Well, what it is...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Mind you, I mean, we did save her life.
What are friends for?
Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Let's open it.
Thats not just any broomstick, Harry.  It's a Nimbus 2000!
Yay!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
Come on, Hermione!
Go!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Fluffy?
Queen to E5.
That's wizard's chess.  I see you've packed.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Change of plans, my parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there.
We've looked a hundred times.
I think we've had a bad influence on her.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Harry wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!
Happy Christmas, Harry.
Oh. My mum made it.  It looks like you've got one too.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Yeah!
There they are.
What is it?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Well, let's see then, put it on.
Whoa!
I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"They're really rare.  I wonder who gave it to you?
Why?
I only see me.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
I'll be right back.  Want to play chess?
We go and visit Hagrid?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't. There's something not quite right about that mirror.
I'm ready! Ask me any question.
...I forgot.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Copy off you?
That's insulting! It's as if they don't trust us!  Dumbledore again!
Leg-Locker Curse?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You have got to start standing up to people, Neville.
'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark"" Wizard Grindelwald in 1945–'
'-for his discovery of the 12 uses of Dragon Blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel!'",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"This is light?
The what?
Immortal?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I know what it means!
We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.
It's bad.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Okay.
But, if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to... kill you, do you?
And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?
Perhaps you should see the nurse.
Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.
It's for your own good, you know.
Sorry.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Wait a minute...he's.... Sleeping.
Uh. It's got horrible breath!
What?!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Ew! Yuck! Ugh.
Ahh!  Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.
Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Hermione!!
Now what are we gonna do?!
Ahh! Harry!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Harry!
Help!
Help! Help me!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Help!
Ahhh!
Yeah.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!
Alohomora!  Well, it was worth a try.
We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!
This complicates things a bit!
Hurry up!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"This is no graveyard.  It's a chessboard.
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight.
Well, white moves first, and then...we play.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You there! D-5!  Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!
Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.
You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you.  Knight...to H-3.
Check.
Ahhhh!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"All right? You?
Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on. Get your trunk!…
You'd better stand back. Let's go!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Come on.
Come on, Harry! Hurry up!
I've got you Harry!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Drive!
Do you think it'd be all right if we had some of this?
It's not much, but it's home.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window!
Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying really.
Morning, Dad.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles, thinks they're fascinating.
Oh, it…
He's always doing that.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum.
Diagon Alley!
Mum fancies him.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Whao!
I don't know. The gateway's sealed its self for some reason.
Harry, if we can't get through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"The car…
Uh, right. Okay.
Oh no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Okay.
We can't be far behind.
We must be gettin' close.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Aaahhh! Aaahhhh! Aaahhh!
Harry! Hold on! Take my hand! Hold on!
Yeah.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Welcome home.
It's not working! Ahhhh!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Huh… Aahh!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Ahh-ha-ha! My wand! Look at my wand!
What's happening?
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Ahh! Ahhhh! Ahh!
Aaaahhhh!
Ahh!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Scabbers, you OK? The car! …Dad's gonna kill me.
Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.
We'll go and get our stuff, then.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You're going to expel us, aren't you?
Huhh… Say it, I'm doomed.
Bloody bird's a menace. Oh, no!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"What do we do now?
Uh-oh. I smell trouble.
Those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones! How did you get those?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs!
It's disgusting.
Hear what?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Kill?
I don't like spiders… What's that?
Are you mad?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Ahem. Vera verto!
Three guesses who.
D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
Of course. You heard him! 'You'll be next Mudbloods,'
Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything.
I'll stop it.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Of course. Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. And now he's taught Draco how to do it.
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girl's lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?
Why?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Who?
Who's Moaning Myrtle?
Who cares?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You're a Parselmouth? Why didn't you tell us?
Oh, that's what you said to it!
I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Exactly! Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great- greatgreat grandson, or something.
How?
Whose hair are you ripping out then?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Ahem…
Yeah. Right.
How thick could you get?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Ugh- essence of Crabbe.
I think I'm gonna be sick!
Uh… Harry?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Bloody hell!
Uh… Bloody hell.
But where's Hermione?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Okay.
What are you doing d- uh, I mean… What are you doing down here?
Uhh…",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Ahem…Stomachache.
S- scar.
That was close!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Look at your tail!
Have you spoken to Hermione?
Yuck!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"But, it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'll just go right through you.
We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.
That'll be a cheerful visit! “Hello, Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?”",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"No!
Who ever it was, they must have been looking for something.
Hermione!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"But you heard McGonagall! We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!
Hagrid's right! With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"What?!
They're headed to the Dark Forest! Why spiders! Why couldn't it be “follow the butterflies?”
Harry, I don't like this… Harry, I don't like this at all!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Can we go back now?
Harry.
Harry!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Ahh- hhh…
Can we panic now?
Know any spells?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Where's Hermione when you need her?
Whoah!
Glad we're out of there! Ah- Aaaah!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Thanks for that.
Aah!
The flying gear's jammed!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I'm trying!
Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him! I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?
What's that?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?
And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.
But how's a basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake- someone would have seen it.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Pipes? It's using the plumbing!
Moaning Myrtle.
'Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever.' Ginny…",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"What about my sister?!
You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!
Is there anything you can do?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue!
Better you than us.
Aaah!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Ugh!
Go on.
What's this?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more! Heart of a lion, this one.
Harry! Harry!
I'm fine!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Um…Ron Weasley.
Lockhart's memory charm backfired. He hasn't got a clue who he is!
No!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"What'll do I do now?
OK.
Yes, sir.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Yes, sir.
Thanks, sir!
Uhh-um… Welcome back, Hermione.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I'm warning you, Hermione. Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
A cat? Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair.
Harry.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Brilliant. Loads of old stuff... like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
Along with the dung beetle.
I haven't shown anyone.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Brilliant.
I still think it was brilliant.
Who do you think that is?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Do you know everything? How is it she knows everything?
Oh.
Let me get this straight. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban to come after you?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Sure. Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before... and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
What's going on?
There's something moving out there. I think... someone's coming aboard.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Bloody hell! What's happening?
Well, you sort of went rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
No. I felt weird, though. Like I'd never be cheerful again.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Shove off, Malfoy.
. Green. That's a monkey. What is that? You call that a monkey? Do not give him one again. Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
I will.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Oh, don't try one of them. Oh, no. Look at him. His face.
Where did you come from?
Sure.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Oh, yeah. Um... Well, Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering. And that there could be the sun and that's happiness. So... you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be... happy about it.
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Hang on. That's not possible. Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination. You have to be in two classes at once.
You're supposed to stroke it.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"That was wicked, Harry!
Listen to the idiot. He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
Who?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"When did she get here?
Riddikulus!
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop. We never did got a chance to go to the Shrieking Shack though. You heard it's the most...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Probably Neville forgotten the password again.
Oh, you're there.
Serves her right. She was a terrible singer.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Werewolves?
When did she come in? Did you see her come in?
He's got a point, you know.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
Well, you fell off your broom.
There's something else you should know too. When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and... Well...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Twice.
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?
Bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
That's not true!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Thick heads.
Gorgeous.
Unless of course you've been ripped to pieces!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I haven't lost anything! Your cat killed him!
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone.
Your cat killed him!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Did.
Spiders! There's... There's spiders. Spiders. They want me to tap-dance. I don't wanna tap-dance!
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental... but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
I'm not going back.
See you.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"It just got worse.
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.
Not good, brilliant!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Scabbers! You're alive!
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
Let's go!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Oh, no.
He bit me! Scabbers!
Scabbers, come back!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Scabbers, you bit me!
Harry, Hermione, run! It's the Grim! Harry!
Help!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Harry it's a trap. He's the dog. He's an Animagus.
Harry! What did you just do?
Me?! He's mental!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Scabbers has been in my family for...
So what?
What are you trying to do to him? Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off!
You better go.
I'm fine. Go.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"So painful. They might chop it.
It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off.
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Nice doggy. Nice doggy!
It's Scabbers who did it.
He's my rat, sir. He's not really a rat. He was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat. But then they gave him an owl...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"What the bloody hell was that all about?
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.
Not good, brilliant.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Scabbers, you're alive!
Let's go.
How did you get there? I was talking to you there. And now you're there.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Quiet. Let the man through. I didn't mean to open it, Harry. It was badly wrapped. They made me do it.
No one knows.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Bloody hell.
Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?
Blimey Dad, how far up are we?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Krum!!!
There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind. He's more than an athlete, he's an artist.
Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.
On second thought, just the drewbals.
Just the drewbals, thanks.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Loads according to Dad, that's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses.
Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!
Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"He was a catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days.
Yes...
Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know.
Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen.
How did you do it?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though.
You know bloody well what.
Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Piss off.
Who you talking to?
I heard voices.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.
You think so?
Anything else?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Fine.
I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire.
Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"At least I warned you about the dragons.
Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought you'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out.
Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Thank you Nigel.
Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Ginny these must be for you.
What are you on about?
Dress robes? for what?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Something's about to burst out of Hilary but I don't think it's a swan.
Where?
Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
Well, us and Neville!
Now I'm really depressed.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Well Hermione, you're a girl.
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad.
Bloody hell.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?
There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out.
What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Bloody hell.
What are those??
Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.
I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.
Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?
Because nobody asked her. I would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud.
No. Absolutely not.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor.
He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy.
Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"No.
He's using you.
Doubt it. He's way too old.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Yeah that is what I think.
Go on.
Well that's completely off the point. Harry...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"They get scary when they get older.
Well... yeah... a bit
Merci.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.
We're still misfits.
Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Well I won't. You know I won't!
Let him breathe, Hermione!
Good to see you, mate.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"We wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get intercepted. There is an awkward silence.
He thought you would be safest there.
We've only seen him twice, and not for very long. He's really busy.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"It's not that fun, mate. Mum won't let us anywhere near the meetings.
We've already told you, we're not privyed to the meetings. But we do know a few things.
What does he get a hug for?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Oh, sure, that's why.
Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all...
Come on, lets go back downstairs!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"What if he were still on his...
What if he's still on his mission from Dumbledore?
You reckon she's here to spy on us?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Well, Harry, shall we start on Snape's report?
Harry! I tried out for Quidditch Keeper at the tryouts! I'm on the team!
Harry--bloody hell!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You said she was making you do lines!
Always knew she was a bit fishy.
""The Hog's Head,"" Hermione?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Not to mention you dueled with You- Know-Who all alone and he still couldn't kill you!
She can't!
Or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"She doesn't look very good.
I'm going to resign.
I'm horrible! I should never have joined.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"This is the worst day of my life.
Come off it, Hagrid! We're not blind!
A month?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"So...no giants are coming?
Lockhart didn't teach as much as prune himself.
Get McGonagall! Go!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Harry! HARRY!
So you're saying this weapon You- Know-Who's after is in the Department of Mysteries?
But why the Department of Mysteries?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Bloody hell!
No way. Quidditch practice. If I don't show up, Angelina'll go mad.
You all right?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"To the Department of Mysteries?
Yeah. They can't just waltz into the Ministry of Magic!
Shut up, Malfoy!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Stupify!
That's just what we were wondering.
So, how do we get to the Ministry?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"What are what?
And what about those of us who can't see them? Luna comes over to them.
Never again...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"What do you mean, people?
Harry, have you seen this?
Er...it's got your name on it.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Hiyya, Harry.
Good as new, mate.
Yeah ?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Harry?  Did someone say Harry?
'Course not.  Think I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?
Harry!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You've a bit of...
Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.  That it's too dangerous.
Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy.  Took a day or two, but she came round.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"A hundred and fifty.  Give or take a few years.
How much for this?
How much for me?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"But I'm your brother!
C'mon. Let's go.
Hi.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.
Is it just me?  Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed?
What're they playing at?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Hey.  Where's Hermione?
Harry, where is she?
Bloody hell.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"One of what?
You're barking.  What would You- Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?
It's a creepy shop.  He's a creepy bloke.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Probably on the platform.  C'mon.
Don' you worry.  He'll be 'long soon 'nuff --
Oi!  Turn around, you lunatic.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Looks like his own this time.
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times -- easy for it to say -- it's a hat, isn't it?  First Years seemed to enjoy it, though. Wankers. Filch give you the wand outside?
That was cheerful.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"But I don't want to take Potions!
Ron Weasley, sir.  But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going --
Hard feelings?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Really?  Strapping guy like you, you've got a Beater's build, don't you think?  Keeper needs to be agile, quick --
Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one.  Hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.
Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione.  Cormac.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Not bloody likely.  He's top of the class.  Even better than you, Hermione.  Slughorn thinks he's a genius.
What?
The who?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Yeah. Right. Well, it's true.  I like a nice chat before I go to bed.  Now you're always reading that bloody book.  It's like being with Hermione.
The library.
Spider?  About six feet tall?  Ten feet wide?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Barking.  Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us? What?
O-kay.
Aw, bloody hell...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I'd like to leave.
That happens to be my sister.
What're you playing at?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Get to know him?
Um... You've got a little...
Bit worried about her.  Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in the pub?  Her and me snogging.  Ha.  As if...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Harry, she's swallowing her tongue --
Believe me, Professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years.
What do you suppose Dean sees in her?  Ginny.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Dean?  He's brilliant.
Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?  Something snaps.  You've got to hate him.  You know, on principle.
So what is it?  He sees in her?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Attractive?
Skin?  You're saying Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?
Hermione's got nice skin. Wouldn't you say?  As skin goes, I mean.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Right.
So.  How was it?
Your dinner party.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I expect you'll be going with McLaggen.  Isn't he a member of the Slug Club?
Really?
I'm resigning.  After today's match.  McLaggen can have my spot.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Sure...
C'mon, Harry.  We've got a game to win.
What's with the birds?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.  What Lav and I have -- well, let's just say there was no stopping it.  It's chemical.  Will it last?  Who knows?  Point is, I'm a free agent.
Unbreakable Vow.  You're sure that's what Snape said.
It's just, well, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"No, you don't understand -- Oh, bloody hell...
All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.
You die.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Lav, c'mon. Of course I'll wear it.
It's beautiful, isn't it?  The moon.
It was on your bed.  The box. Thought I'd try one...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.
She could never annoy me.  I think... I think I love her.
Do you think she knows I exist?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Snogging?  Who're you talking about?
Romilda, of course.  Romilda Vane.
It's no joke!  I'm in love with her!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"No.  Can you introduce me?
How do I look?
Where's Romilda?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Hello, darling.  Fancy a drink?
What's this?
What happened to me?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I feel really... bad.
These girls are gonna kill me, Harry.
Er... My... Nee... Er!  My!  Nee!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Huh?
Tell me again how I broke up with Lavender?
Don't get me wrong.  I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.  It's just she seems... a bit put out.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Well... there is... something. But no.  It can't be.  Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn't I?
So.  Did you and Ginny do it?
You know.  Hide the book.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?
No.
No.  I got an owl from Dad this morning.  The one at Borgin & Burke's?  It's still there.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Good luck, mate.
What are those?
C'mon.  Mum's got dinner ready.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Never done that before, have we?
I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo.
Hey ya -- Well... thanks.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Always the tone of surprise.
Going somewhere?
For you?  You think Madeye died for you?  You think George took that curse for you?  You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"And leave Hermione?  Are you mad? We wouldn't last two days without her.
Don't tell her I said that. Besides, you've still got the Trace on you.  And there's the wedding...
Bill and Fleur.  Mum's been planning it for months.  Only thing that's kept her sane, I reckon.  She'll kill me if I miss it.  Kill you too.  Rather go face to face with You-Know-Who if I'm honest.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Tonight's not the night, mate. You'd only be doing him a favor.
Do you think he knows?
I mean, they're bits of his soul, the Horcruxes.  Bits of him.  When Dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary all those years ago -- he must've felt something right?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"What I'm saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy them one by one...
Won't he know he's being hunted?
Dunno.  But something tells me he didn't come to give away the bride.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Dumbledore?  And me?  I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley to him.  He was always polite --
Dumbledore left this?  For me? Brilliant.  Er -- what is it?
Wicked.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Mum used to read me those!  The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbitty Rabbity and her Cackling Stump...
Oh, c'mon!  Beedle's stories are famous!  Babbity Rabbitty? No...?
Where are we?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"How the ruddy --
You're amazing, you are.
They were after you, mate.  We'd just put everyone in danger going back.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"What she said.
So where do we go from here?  The Leaky Cauldron?
By the way -- these jeans?  Not my favorite.  Bit tight.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"This is Dolohov.  I recognize him from the wanted posters.
So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?
Suppose it's him that did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You're the boss. Hermione?
You're the best with spells.
Can't be. The Trace breaks at seventeen. It's Wizarding law.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"What?
We've got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe.
What was that about?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Good!  Tell him from me he's a git!
Hey!  I think you two better come down here.
The two clinging to the tree are Death Eaters for sure.  Dunno 'bout the bloke on the bench. Can't see us, of course.  But we'll have to be careful coming and going.  C'mon.  There's something else you need to see.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"R.A.B. was Sirius' brother?
Kreacher...
You're a thief, Dung.  Everyone knows it.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Wicked trainers.
Piece of advice.  Let's not rehash old times.  Got it... mate?
No.  He's worried he should have got more money for it.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Right. So let's do it.  Who gets who?
The world's mental.  Come on, drink up.  We've got a Horcrux to find.
In case you're interested, I'm Reg Cattermole, Magical Maintenance Department.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Oh... yeah.  Thanks.
What do you reckon he meant by 'Good luck.'?
That's bloody disgusting.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit.
They're not Ministry.  They're Snatchers.  They hunt Muggle-borns and blood-traitors for a price.
Really?  Have you tried an umbrella?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Downstairs...?
Oh my god.  What am I going to do? My wife's all alone downstairs?
No, that's mad.  You two find Umbridge.  I'll be fine.  But how do I stop it raining?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Finite Incantatem, okay.  And if that doesn't work...?
M-morning.
Harry!  Blimey, I forgot what you looked like.  Where's Hermione?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Bloody cold down here.
What is it?
'Tis, isn't it?  This'll be one to tell the kids.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Mary.  Go home.  Get the kids. I'll... I'll meet you there.  We have to get out the country, understand?
Mary!  Do as I say!
I'm sorry.  It's just --",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Long story.  Nice meeting you.
Piss off.
No, don't!  Don't say it!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"It's taboo -- You-Know-Who's name. That's how they track people now. It's how they found us in the cafe that night.
I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry.  Blimey, what's that smell?
Not bloody likely.  Smells like something Ginny would cook.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Is that it?
... alive.
It's angry.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Seems strange, mate.  Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn't bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn't that bother you?
I'm hungry.
Leave it.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Mum can make food appear out of thin air.
Oh, speak English, can't you?
I said leave it.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Yeah.  Brilliant.  Only, correct me if I'm wrong... wasn't that yesterday's plan?  And the day before that?  And the day before that?  Walk.  Sleep.  Walk. Sleep.
He doesn't know what he's doing, does he?
Wizards were here.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"The sword was stolen.
Yeah, I'm still here.  But you two carry on.  Don't let me spoil your fun.
Problem?  There's no problem.  Not according to you, anyway.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"All right, I'll spit it out. Don't expect me to skip up and down because now there's some other damn thing we've got to find.
Yeah, I thought I did too.
No, I just reckoned after all this time, we'd have actually achieved something.  I reckoned you knew what you were doing.  I reckoned Dumbledore had told you something worthwhile! I reckoned you had a plan!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Yeah, and we're about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we!
Don't lie!  You said it, too, you said you were disappointed --
Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night?  Do you!  To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name or Fred or George or Mum or --",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"And you?
Are you staying?  Or coming?
Fine.  I get it.  I saw you two the other night.  Yeah, that's right.  Didn't know I knew, did you?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Are -- you -- mental?
Well, yeah.  Bit obvious, I'd think.
No.  I reckoned it was you.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Right.  Antlers.
No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there --
Anything?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"And we did, didn't we?
What?  No.  Harry.  That thing's bad for me.  I can't handle it. I'm not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione.  It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse.
No.  I can't --",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I left.
Saving your life.
And just think of it.  Only three to go.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Hey.
Wo -- hey -- ouch!
How come he's got your wand?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"No, of course not.  I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux!  Why would that change anything!  Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you!  To see you doing those things --
Look, I wanted to come back the minute I'd left.  I just... didn't know how to find you.
With this.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"It doesn't just turn off lights. I don't know exactly how it works, but Christmas morning I -- I was sleeping -- in this little pub-- I'd given some Snatchers the slip the night before, me being a blood- traitor and all -- anyway, I was sleeping when I heard it...
A voice.
Your voice, Hermione.  Coming out of this.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"My name.  Just my name.  Like a whisper.
So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared.  And I knew.
Just knew.  On account of Hermione's voice.  And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I could feel it inside me.  It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea.  And I knew it would take me where I needed to go.
So I Disapparated and came out on this hillside.  It was dark.  I didn't have any idea where I was. I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end. And you did.
I've always liked it.  These flames Hermione makes.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"How long you reckon she'll stay mad at me?
It was true.  Every word.
Bloody hell.  I just realized. You need a wand, right?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Well, I've got one.  Here.  It's Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.  I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back.
Don't tell Hermione, but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.  This one was definitely part Troll.  The smell off him...
Wo.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Nothing.
Maybe a bit more practice, eh?
All right.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"But what does it mean?
I think Hermione's right.  I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What say we vote on it?  Those in favor...
Sorry, Harry.  Looks like it's Hermione and me this time.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Luna?
Keep off the dirigible plums.
Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help Harry?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"He's mental.  Let's face it. Luna's always good value, but she's nutty as squirrel poo.
Well, yeah, of course.  It's massive, isn't it?
Yeah, all right...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"The what?
Yes.
Midnight.  Mum always said midnight. But twilight's fine.  Better actually.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Let's get out of here once he's back.  I'm not touching this stuff, hot or cold.
The Wand.
You're supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible.  Dead boring if you ask me.  But an unbeatable wand!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you'd lead.
Not like Harry's.  I've seen a fair few.  Dad used to bring home the ones the Ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like. They always got holes or tears. Harry's is different.  It's perfect.
You forgot the water.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"For the tea.
Nooooooooo!
That treacherous old bleeder!  Is there no one we can trust!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I'll do the enchantments.
Don't touch her!
Stan Shunpike.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Weasley... Barney Weasley.
Piss off!  Arthur Weasley's ten times the wizard you are!
What are we gonna do? We can't leave Hermione alone with her.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"We have to do something.
Let her go.
Works for me.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth. Trust me.
Like hell.
Expellliarmus!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Then you're on our side.
Who put it there? The fake.
And if we find one? How're we supposed to destroy it if we've given Griphook the sword?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You're sure it's hers?
You heard Ollivander. It's Harry's now.
How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"That's a bit scary.
Always good value. I'll miss her.
What d'you think?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You want to tell me what that is?
You mean he could see you?
Go on.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Bloody hell... that's a sight.
Hideous.
Couldn't do anything about that bit in the back that's always flipping up, could you? Dead annoying --",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Never mind. I'm good.  That is you in there, isn't it?
Hey. Easy.
What do you mean?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Harry, what do we do? Harry...?
What's that? Up ahead.
You don't say.  Just out of interest... is there any other way out of here?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Imperio!
No. It's not possible...
Bloody hell. That's a Welsh Green.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
Lumos !
Blimey...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?
Keep going!
The cup!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Foul little git. Least we've got Bogrod.
That's unfortunate.
You're asking us? You're the brilliant one.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"That's your idea?
That was brilliant! BRILLIANT!
Bloody hell.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I say we jump!
Never mind! What did you see?
What happens when he finds out four are gone?",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"What?
'Fraid he's right. One problem: Snape's Headmaster now. We can't just walk in the front door.
Maybe it's because of the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"What's he mean by that?
Did you get a look at him! Fora second I thought it was --
Who's that with her? Bloody hell...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"I don't remember this being on the Marauder's Map.
Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what's a bloody diadem?
Six months she hasn't seen me and it's like I'm Frankie First Year. I mean, I'm only her brother.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Shut up, Seamus.
Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn't really matter if we find the Horcrux.
So we were thinking --",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You destroyed Tom Riddle's Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we know where we might find one, don't we?
Harry talks in his sleep. Haven't you noticed?
I've never got this far before.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Me too. Hermione: I didn't expect it to be like this.
You do it.
Yes, you can.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Bloody hell. We/'ll never find him on this.
Brilliant.
Let's go.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"RUN! Goyle's set the bioody place on fire!
Serves him right.
Brilliant.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"You're bloody well welcome!
Where will he take her?
Look inside him, Harry.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we're one step closer to ending this.
He's gone. The snake too.
Never! Do you hear me! NEVER!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"We thought you'd gone to the forest, we thought you might be --
Are you mad! No!
Rubbish! You can't just give yourself up to him -- Hermione squeezes Ron's arm, silencing him.",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Liar!
He saved your life.
Well done, Malfoy!",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,"Hermione!
Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we?
But that means...",Good,3,Undead
ron weasley,What do you reckon we should do with it?,Good,3,Undead
woman,"Anything off the trolley, dears?
Don't despair, Elphias.  I'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter.  In 800 pages no less.

Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.
Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...  Oculus Reparo.  That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon.  You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there.
It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.
Oh, no. Okay, relax.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?
I've read about those. When the smoke turns red,  it means you've forgotten something.
Up. Up. Up. Up.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly.  What an idiot.
You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.
The staircases change, remember?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.
Oh, move over!  Alohomora.  Get in.
Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Filch is gone.
It was locked.
You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed... or worse, expelled!
Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Leviosar.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Wingardium Leviosa.
Help! Help!
Ahhh! Help!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Swish and flick!
Is it...dead?
It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.
Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.
Blood?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"But why would anyone go near that dog?
So you're saying...
Bit early for mail, isn't it?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!
Leave it to me.
Lacarnum Inflamarae.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Whoo-hoo!
That thing has a name?
Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I don't know.
That's totally barbaric!
See you haven't.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Good, you can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.
Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas.
Look at you playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"All right, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?
And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?
No, you won't! Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Follow me!
I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
Of course! Here it is!  ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!""",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.""
It means you'll never die.
""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.
Is that...a dragon?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.
Harry!
You mean You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Hang on a minute.  We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched.
I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.
It's happened before.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"What is it?
And with Dumbledore gone
Uh...we were just...",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Now what do we do?
Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this... Petrificus Totalus.
Sorry.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Ow! You stood on my foot!
Alohomora.
The harp. It stopped playing.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.
Just relax!
Do what I say. Trust me.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Are you okay?
He's not relaxing, is he?
We've got to do something!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology.
Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,  it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!  Lumus Solem!
What is that?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
What's this all about?
Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"What's wrong, Harry?
I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
Now what do we do?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"What happens now?
Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?
What is it?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"No, Ron, you can't!  There must be another way!
You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.
Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Never better.
We're tied with Slytherin!
Come on, Harry.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?
Harry! Hagrid!
Oh, it's so good to see you!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"What did you do to your glasses? Oculus reparo.
Ok! Bye!
Come on! Everyone's been so worried.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.

At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got it on pure talent.
You okay, Ron? Say something!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"He called me a Mudblood.
It means “dirty blood.” Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
Harry!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Voice? What voice?
Harry, wait! Not so fast!
'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened… enemies the heir… beware.' It's written in blood.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when he said…
It's a bit strange, isn't it?
You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just… strange.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.
Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about…the Chamber of Secrets?
Muggle-borns.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"If you're talking about Malfoy.
I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Here it is. 'The Polyjuice Potion.'  'Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.'
Yes.
Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"A month.
I know. But it's the only plan we've got.
No! Even with a proper wand it's too risky. You could hit Harry!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Let's go.
Finite incantatem!
Are you okay?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"You will be able to, won't you?
Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Heh… No. No one ever comes in here.
Moaning Myrtle.
Moaning Myrtle.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"She's a little sensitive.
Do you think he's all right?
Oh!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"You can talk to snakes.
No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad.
I don't know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"He lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.
Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I've got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their uniforms.
I've already got mine. Millicent Bulstrode– Slytherin- I got this off her robes. I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves… Add the hairs.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Cheers!
Me too.
I- I don't think I'm going. You go on without me!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Just go. You're wasting time!
Go away!
Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat's hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes. Look at my face.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.
Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?
No!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn't a student.
Thanks, Sir Nicholas!
It's good to be back! Congratulations! I can't believe you solved it!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Thanks.
Oh, no!
It's a cat, Ronald. What do you expect? It's in his nature.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"That's rich... coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
You know the Egyptians used to worship cats?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
Come on. Everywhere else is full.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Professor R.J. Lupin.
It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
Seems to be. Why?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean, everyone's looking for him.
Why are we stopping? We can't be there yet.
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry. Harry, are you all right?
No one was screaming, Harry.
Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Just forget it.
What a load of rubbish.
Me? I've been here all this time.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline. Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
A fair few.
Don't be silly Ron. How could anyone be in two classes at once? Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future!.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I think they're funny.
Just ignore him.
Hagrid! He has to be taken to the hospital.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Yeah but I heard Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this.
Dufftown? That's not far from here.
No one knows.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most. That's what makes them so...
It's not funny, Ron.
But sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks. We're not meant to start that for weeks.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice. With each full moon, when he transforms, he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path. Furthermore, the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!
How are you feeling?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Umm... no one blames you, Harry. The dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds. Dumbledore's furious. As soon as he saved you, he sent them off.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
Do you want to move a bit closer?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Hope you don't mean yourself!
Harry!
But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Oh, Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta. Ron fancies her.
Harry!
So rude.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Ron, look! Sorry, sorry. Excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Harry, what happened?
Beautiful day.
Ronald has lost his rat.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Rubbish.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
Did not.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?
And then?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Oh, do you mind me trying? The Grim, possibly.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"That felt good.
We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.
I think that means you owe someone an apology.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I meant me!
I thought I just saw... Never mind.
Ron. Ron! Ron!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
Ron! Ron, wait! Harry!
Duck!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where do you suppose this goes?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Ron. You're okay. The dog. Where is it?
If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"No! I trusted you! And all this time, you've been his friend. He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes.
Since Professor Snape set the essay.
You attacked a teacher!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"You go, I'll stay.
That looks really painful.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry!
Harry!
Wait! Wait!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Professor? Professor Lupin?
Harry?
What?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius. Any minute the dementors are going to perform the Kiss.
No. It's worse. Much worse. They're going to suck out his soul. Headmaster, you've got to stop them. They've got the wrong man.
The point is, we know the truth. Please believe us.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
7:30. Where were we at 7:30?
Come on. And we can't be seen.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
Yes. Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Thanks. Malfoy's coming.
That felt good.
Of course. Remember what Dumbledore said? If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. Let's go.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Harry, you can't.
Yes, and you must! Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. If you just go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time. We can't be seen.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Fudge is coming. And we aren't leaving? Why aren't we leaving?
Sorry. We're coming out the back door. Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I thought I just saw... Never mind.
Okay, go, Harry. Go!
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Keep trying. Come on. Quickly. Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay? Come on. Come on, Buckbeak. Come and get the nice dead ferret. Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Buckbeak.
We save Sirius.
No idea. Look. It's Lupin.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
At least someone's enjoying himself.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Yeah?
With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore. According to him... only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
Harry, but your dad's... Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Here we come.
That's great.
Harry! Run!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Saving your life!
Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!
That was so scary.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"This is horrible.
Harry, listen to me. No one's coming.
You're dying... both of you. Harry!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"We have to go.
What's he talking about, Harry?
This came with it.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"How fast is it, Harry?
Harry!
Are you alright?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Just now. You?
Wake up. Wake up Ronald!
Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"What??
Harry it's his mark.
This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.
You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream.
Alastor Moody? The aura.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Three sir.
Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will...
Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face.
Neville?
It's not going to work.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.
So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.
Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?
Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you.
Uhhh...",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you.
I'm NOT an owl!
Pssst! Harry? Is that you?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...
Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.
Your wand harry! Your wand!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Boys.
Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.
They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.
Oh well spotted.
I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"What?
No of course.
She said yes??",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?
What's got your wand in a knot?
The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself.
What? What? That's what you think?
You know the solution then don't you.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort.
Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you.
Ron you spoil everything!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now.
I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?
I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry, tell me again.
The black lake, that's obvious.
Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.
But sir, the second task is only hours away and...
Harry!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably.
Next to last.
Bye.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"No.
Everything's going to change now isn't it?
Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry will won't you?
Harry!
Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are you furious with us, I bet you are!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Come on, inside.
Sorry we haven't written, Harry, but Dumbledore made us promise not to.
He was so angry when he heard. It was...scary...",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, like Lucious Malfoy.
The Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore started it last time to fight You-Know-Who. He only reorganized it after last term.
They'll have to let you off, Harry... You were defending",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Would you like a hug?
Harry, Ron and I, we've been named House Prefects! She hands Harry a letter.
What about you, Harry?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Are you sure? I would have thought you would get one!
I hope he's all right...
I wanted to know something about your course aims.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"But surely the whole point of Defense against the dark arts is practical application?
No, but-
But we've got O.W.L.s coming up! You expect us to do the spells with no practice?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"How can Dumbledore let that horrible woman teach? And when we're taking our OWL tests too!
Well, not us specifically, but definitely Dumbledore and the Order.
Good luck, Harry.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Hey, Harry.
Have you seen Ron? I can't find him anywhere.
He's been acting fishy all week. He's up to something.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"He's got to be taken to the hospital wing.
That old hag! She's sick!
Harry, I really think you should tell--",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Hagrid's still not back yet. I hope he's all right.
Harry, you can't write to him! Owls are being intercepted, it isn't safe.
You think she's working for You- Know-Who?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I suppose so. He could have her under the Imperious Curse, though it's unlikely. Dumbledore'd know.
There we are.
Come on, I'll explain in a minute.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"These are some people I mentioned my Defense Against the Dark Arts idea with.
Obviously, this will help us pass our O.W.L.s, but more importantly, it gives us the ability to protect ourselves from...Lord Voldemort. Several people jump or wince in fear at the name.
That's true, but I think we're drifting from the purpose--",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Well...anyway...uh, I think that in order to learn properly we'll need a teacher.
So all in favor of taking lessons from Harry?
Where are we going to meet?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Ok, good.
I think we should put our names down, so we know who was here.
Honestly, Ernie, do you think I'd just leave it lying around? Besides, its enchanted.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Also, what should we call ourselves?
We'll let you know when we're going
I think that went well.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"And did you see Cho, Harry?
Well, she couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?!
No, they couldn't have. The parchment we all signed was enchanted, like I said. No one can betray the D.A. without us knowing.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"She's hurt!
Harry, you'd better take her to Professor Grubby-Plank. She'll know what to do.
Harry, are you all right?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I know something that could cheer you up.
Hagrid's back!
That's got to be what Surgis Podmore was doing in the Ministry when he was arrested.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"It makes perfect sense, Ron. It's got to be something the Ministry's been developing. Something top secret.
Look at this. There's been a mass escape from Azkaban.
Yes.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Hagrid...we've been walking for a good hour.
We won't let her!
Of course we'll help.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Hagrid, I thought none of them wanted to come!
Oh, why, Hagrid? Why?
How do you know?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"How'd Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without being seen? I mean, he and Sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world...
It just seems so unlikely, Harry!
Think, Harry! Voldemort knows you! He knows you'd rush off to save Sirius.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Yes, they can, Harry.
Before we do anything, we need to establish that Sirius really isn't at Headquarters. Which means we'll need to break into Umbridge's office.
Mind you, it's got to be really good!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"We'll also need to keep everyone away from her office.
We'll probably only manage five minutes or so.
Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"No! Please, stop!
We have to tell her, Harry...
We were trying to find Professor Dumbledore. We had to tell him...",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"That it's ready. The weapon.
Oh, yes. It's very well hidden.
Don't call them that!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Grawp, help us!
I thought it worked out rather nicely.
I'd imagine we should fly.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"There's nothing there, Harry.
Well, let's try a few.
There's no one here, Harry. This isn't the right room.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry, I think we should leave.
I don't think Sirius is here.
Don't touch it, Harry!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Stupify!
Colloportus!
Harry, they went the wrong way!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Silenco! Stupify!
Harry!
Come on, let's go in to the feast.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Take your time, Harry. We'll be here when you are.
What's that ?
Was that an owl I heard?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Really?
Harry!
A few days ago.  Though... for a bit, I wasn't sure I was coming.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"She's not alone.  Even my parents -- and they're Muggles -- know something bad is happening.
There's been a lot of chatter lately.  That he's gotten... old.
These are adorable.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"How is it Fred and George are doing it?  Half the alley's closed down.
Oh no.  Look.
But everyone got their wands from Ollivander.  Young.  Old...",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Sorry.
I don't know.
Stop, Harry, I know where you're going with this --",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
I told you.  I don't know what I saw.
Where's Harry?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Will.  You.  Stop.  Eating!  Your best friend is missing!
Where've you been, Harry?  And what happened to your face?
What's happened to his hand?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Granger, sir.  That one there is Veritaserum.  And that would be Polyjuice Potion.  And that is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world.
It's rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them.  For example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste --
Liquid luck.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"How did you do that?
No.  The instructions specifically say to cut.
Sh!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"He's vile.
No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.
I'd like to know just whose book that was.  Let's take a look, shall we?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Why not?
The binding is fragile?
The who?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?
Well, I was curious.  So I went to
And... nothing.  There's no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"What've you got there, Hagrid?
Stinksap?  You're not sick, are you?
The Aurors. I know they're here to protect us, but... somehow I don't feel any safer.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Three Butterbeers.  Splash of ginger in mine, please.
Oh, honestly, Ronald.  They're just holding hands...
And snogging.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Leave?  You can't be serious.
So?  What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me?  Would you expect her to get up and leave?
Be delighted, sir.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"What's up?
I'll get someone --
My parents are dentists.  They tend to people's teeth.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"No.  Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches.
Look at her eyes.  They've been fighting again.  Her and Dean.
Nothing.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"How was what?
Dead boring.  Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
Ol' Sluggy's having a Christmas do, you know.  And we're meant to bring someone...",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Actually, I was going to ask you.
Really.  But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --
Don't drink that, Ron!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"You could be expelled for that.
Ron seems to be enjoying himself.
You shouldn't have done it, Harry.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"That was different.  It was tryouts.  This was an actual match --
You didn't put it in? Ron only thought you did?
Charms spell.  Just practicing.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"How does it feel, Harry?  When you see Dean with Ginny? I know, Harry.  You're my best friend.  I see how you look at her.
Oppugno!
He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes.  I really couldn't care less.  Was I under the impression that he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party together?  Yes.  Of course, now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Yes.  Why?
Why didn't I think of that?
Um... it's a surprise.  Besides, it's you we need to worry about. And you can't pick just anyone. See that girl over there.  That's Romilda Vane.  Rumor has it she's trying to slip you a love potion.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.  You know that, right?
Hm?  Oh, I've just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac.  Under the mistletoe.
I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he's a menace.  He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"No thank you.
On second thought -- maybe it'll keep Cormac at bay.  Oh no, here he comes!
You have to realize who you are, Harry.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Sorry. So tell me what Arthur said.
What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?
He looks different, don't you think?  Draco.  Almost... ill.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Excuse me, I have to go vomit.
Dead. Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol' Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret?  Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One.
You're going to have to persuade him somehow.  And now, I'm afraid, you've made it a lot harder.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"That's... not possible.  No one can leave the castle these days. The Map is wrong.
I might ask you the same.
I happen to be his... friend.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting.
Oh shut up.
Ron.  Stop.  You're making it snow.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don't believe it was a long conversation --
Does, doesn't she?  And you say you don't remember a thing from that night?  Not one thing?
Right.  Boggled...",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"That's Katie.  That's Katie Bell.
Well?  How do you feel?
Now remember.  Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and then returns to his office.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"What?  No, Harry -- you've got to go see Slughorn.  We have a plan --
No.
Harry.  It's time.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"If one wants it to be.  Why?
Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!
What if there are?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Dumbledore.
Strange.  Thinking this is a piece of Voldemort's soul...
'To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.  I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.  I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more.  R.A.B.'",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Ron's okay with it, you know.  You and Ginny.  But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.
We reckoned -- Ron and me.
I've always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you're really thick.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"You don't honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry.
Like that's going to happen.
Besides, he's barking.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Yes, but I'm exceptionally perceptive.
Do you think we'll ever... come back?
Coming, Mum.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Obliviate.
Goodbye.
I told you he'd take it well.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry, your eyesight really is awful.
Really?
We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"To Harry!  It belongs to Harry! It chose him!  It came to him in the Chamber of Secrets when he most needed it!
Where is your guard, sir?
Ron!  Ron!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Shaftesbury Avenue.  I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad.  Just popped into my head.  I don't know why...
This way!
We need to change.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Undetectable Extension Charm.
Always the tone of surprise.
That'll be the books.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Ron's right.  Cappuccino, please.
Too dangerous.  If Voldemort's taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.
I've had the essentials packed for days.  Just in case.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Petrificus Totalus! Go.
She doesn't argue.
Obliviate.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Maybe you still have the Trace on you.
We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.  Ginny and I -- we'd prepared a cake.  We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding...
Right.  Perspective.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Mad-eye's doing, I'd guess.  In case Snape decided to come snooping.
Homenum revelio.
It's a spell to reveal human presence.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"We're alone.
Harry!  Harry!
Ron!  I've found him!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry, you can't just disappear. We thought --
It's from your Mum.  To Sirius. Bathilda Bagshot...?
Did she now?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry.  I can imagine why you'd want to go there, but... I don't think Bathilda Bagshot is going to know where Voldemort hid his Horcruxes.
Lovely.
Yes.  Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Maybe he knows.
But was it here?  Did you ever see it?
Ron!  RON!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"They have flesh memories.
Snitches.  They're never touched by bare skin until the Seeker captures it.  Even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves.  That way, if there's a dispute, the Snitch can identify who first touched it.
When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open at your touch -- that Dumbledore had hidden something in it.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Expelliarmus!
Stop lying!
You've still got it.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Well, unless one of you fancies wearing a skirt...
Remember what we said.  Keep your eyes down.  Don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.  Act as normal as possible.  Just do what you see everyone else doing. We do that -- and with a bit of luck -- we get ourselves inside. And then...
Correct.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Completely, utterly, without question.
Mafalda Hopkirk, assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office.
You're somebody.  Be careful.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Muggles.  In their rightful place.
You appear to be quite popular.
I didn't.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Try Finite Incantatem.  Of course if something's gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm --
This is you.
I don't like him being on his own down there.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"You really have horrible teeth, you know that.
Relashio!
Harry... they've seen you.  We've got to get out of here.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry, quickly, in my bag, there's a small bottle labeled 'Essence of Dittany.'
Quickly!
Unstopper it.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Just do it!
We were.  We were there.  But Yaxley had hold of me.  I knew we couldn't stay once he'd seen, so when he let go I brought us here. Ron got Splinched.  I'm... sorry.
It's all I feel safe doing.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...
Protective enchantments.  I don't fancy another visit like we had on Shaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on the tent...
Repello Muggletum... Muffliato...",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"How're the mushrooms?  Seem to be the only edible things growing round here.
Make sure to leave some for Ron.
He'll be alright in a few days. Hopefully.  If we could take him to Hogwarts, to Madam Pomfrey --",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"So where do we go next?
It scares me a bit, that, thinking it's a piece of Vol--
Dinner?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Tea?
I hate it.  It's like he's here with us.
Incendio!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Confringo!
What're you doing?
I can put it in my bag --",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I thought it had stopped.
You can't let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it.  You have to close your mind.  It's too dangerous --
Tell me. What you saw.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"The wandmaker?
Viktor got his wand from Gregorovitch.  Most Durmstrang students did at one time.  What's he got to do with You-Know-Who?
Don't -- It... comforts him.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I think he just hopes he doesn't hear bad news.  It gets him through the day.
We've all made sacrifices, Harry.
I don't know.  It takes time.  I'm doing all I can.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Take it off.
Take it off.  Now.
Better?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"It's cold.  Even though it's been lying against your skin for days.
We'll take turns.  Okay?
He could smell it.  My perfume.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I told you.  Ron's not strong enough to Apparate.
No one can conjure food out of thin air.  Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law.  The other four are --
Good plan.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"None of us do.
I don't like this place.
I want to go.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I'll tell you in a minute.
Alright.  The Sword of Gryffindor? It's Goblin made.
You don't understand.  Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry.  You already destroyed one Horcrux, right?  Tom Riddle's diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets.
Don't you see!  In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor.
Its blade is impregnated with basilisk venom.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Exactly!  Which means...
Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.
Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Ron...
Take it off, Ron.  Please take it off.  You wouldn't be talking like this if you hadn't been wearing it all day --
Harry, we weren't --",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I didn't!  Not like that!  Harry -- I didn't!
Stop!  Stop!
Me?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"What?  Ron, no -- please --
He's gone.
It's a Muggle station.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"'I open at the close?'
I don't know.  But look, I've found something as well...
I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don't think it is. It isn't a rune and it's not in Spellman's Syllabary either.  And it's been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn't part of the book.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"What d'you mean -- wearing it?
Why would someone have drawn it in a children's book?
And it's exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"It's dangerous, Harry.  But I have to admit, recently even I've been thinking we might have to go.  I think it's possible something else is hidden there. The sword.  If Dumbledore didn't want it falling into the Ministry's hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself?
Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?
Don't ever let me give you a haircut again.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I still think we should've used Polyjuice Potion.
Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve! Listen...
Yeah. I think they would.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry.
No.  But look.
Did you know he had a sister?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Lumos.
Ignotus... Hey, Har --
Happy Christmas, Harry.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry...
Someone's watching us.  By the gate.
I don't think this is a good idea.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave.
Omigod.  Harry...
Harry, I'm not sure about this.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"There's something odd about her. And what's that smell?
You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot.
All right...",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Why?
Harry...
Harry!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Confringo!
Harry... Harry, can you hear me...?
Good.  That's good...",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Yes.
I'm fine.  But you've been sick. Rest... Rest a bit more...
The Forest of Dean.  I came here once with my mum and dad, years ago.  It's just how I remember it. The trees.  The river.  It's like nothing's changed.  Not true, of course.  Everything's changed.  If I brought my parents here, they wouldn't recognize any of it.  Not the trees.  Not the river.  Not... me.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney, Australia.  They have two dogs, run a small sweet shop, but floss daily.  No children.
Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.  Grow old.
You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was.  Well, I know.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"It was in Bathilda's sitting room. Rita Skeeter had sent it to her. Harry, it doesn't make for very nice reading --
Yes.
For a time.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Gellert Grindelwald.  He's not very well known in Britain, but there was a time, before You-Know- Who...
When Grindelwald was seventeen, he was expelled from Durmstrang. He'd started doing some twisted things at school -- experiments. A few teachers had always protected him, but they couldn't anymore.  After he left, he traveled for awhile, then ended up in Godric's Hollow where his great aunt lived, Bathilda Bagshot.
She introduced him to Dumbledore. It made sense.  Dumbledore's mother had just died, Grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant -- they'd never really had anyone they could talk to on the same level.  They did a lot of talking that summer.  But they always returned to one particular subject.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Wizard rule over Muggles.
Yes.
It was something Dumbledore came up with.  He believed wizards were superior and should rule over Muggles, but gently, for their own good.  Grindelwald took a more violent position.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer.  Dumbledore was young --
He changed, Harry.  Years later, it was Dumbledore who put Grindelwald in prison.
It's my fault.  As we were leaving Godric's Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I'm sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different --",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Maybe we can --
He loved you, Harry.  I know he loved you.
Who could look at you beside Harry Potter?  What are you, compared with the Chosen One...?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him...
Everything all right?
You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley!  You crawl back here after all these weeks and say, 'Hey?' Where's my wand?  Harry, where's my wand!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry Potter, you give me my wand!
Never mind why he's got my wand --
What is that?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"You destroyed it?
Don't think this changes anything.
See me doing what things?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"What happened out there?
And what may I ask did I say?
What's going on in there?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"We need to talk.
I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.
See this?  It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.  It's the mark again.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"It keeps cropping up.  Here.  In Beedle the Bard.  In the graveyard in Godric's Hollow -- what?
Where?
Harry, you don't have a clue where the next Horcrux is.  And neither do I.  But this, this means something.  I'm sure of it.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I'm always mad at him.
Luna.
Do you see that?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"No!  Don't go near it!
It's an Erumpent horn.  It's a Class B Tradeable Material.
Where is Luna, sir?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"The what?
Yes.
It's in here.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Granger.  Well... all right. There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight --
In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass...
Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"It's obvious, isn't it?
The Cloak.
Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Why the Stone, Harry?
But according to the story they don't want to come back.  It's all rubbish anyway.  There's no such thing as the Deathly Hallows.
There have always been Cloaks --",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Mr. Lovegood.  Thank you, sir --
No matter, sir.  We really ought to be go--
Ron!  Harry!  Take my hand!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"What're you saying?
Stop it!
Penelope Clearwater.  Half-blood.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"A Stinging Jinx.
Not long.
I didn't take anything. Please. I didn't take anything.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Please! please!
Harry, are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?
Positive. Harry turns to the two wands on the table -- the ones he showed Ollivander -- and extends the longest to Hermione.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"But I hate that thing -- that's the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel...
It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --
It's perfect. Thank you, Fleur.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"He's right. I was being stupid.
It looks like it's been down here forever.
That's barbaric. I...",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Lumos !
Look.
No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"It's hot! All eyes turn to the bowl, WOBBLING MADLY on the floor, when... it SPLITS APART and begins to MULTIPLY.
Ron, your foot!
How're we going to reach it?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry! Behind you!
In here!
We can't just stand here! Who's got an idea?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"I've got something. But it's mad.
Relashio!
It doesn't realize it's free!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"When?
How is it you --
You let him in! Harry, you can't --",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"What?
You saw it?
Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what --",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"They were ready for us.
No, you'll give us away.
I know.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Harry! I can see you! In here!
Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?
That's Ariana, isn't it? Your sister. She's beautiful.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"She died very young, didn't she.
Mr. Dumbledore... thank you.
Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That doesn't seem like someone who's given up, does it?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"She's coming back! And she's got someone with her!
How bad is it, Neville? With Snape as Headmaster.
They did that to you? But why?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Unless we can destroy it.
You were thinking. It's Ron's idea. And it's brilliant.
Where are you going?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"No. Of course not.
I'm scared.
Not this.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"There he is.
He vanished. Just now. I saw it. Ron glances at MAP -- then:
That's right. I did.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Brilliant.
Did you see where it went? The diadem!
Do we climb!",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"C'mon! This way!
Someplace safe.
Where is everyone?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Where've you been?
What is it, Harry? What is it you
I'll go with you. I/'ll --",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Yes!
I don't want you to say anything you wouldn't say if we weren't about to be killed by a giant snake! It'll just ruin it!
What's the matter with her?",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"Can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.
Something my mum used to say.
Why didn't it work for him? The Elder wand.",Good,3,Undead
hermione granger,"We?
Don't forget to give Professor Longbottom our best.",Good,3,Undead
neville longbottom,"Trevor!  Sorry.
Seamus, that picture's moving!
The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Oh...
AHH!
Down! Down! Ahhhh!",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Help!!!
AHH!
Help!",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh!  Oh. Ah...help!  Ahh!
Owowowow.
Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Gryffindor!
How? I can barely stand at all!
No, that's all I need... you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire!",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Hey, wait, where are you going? What about the counter-curse?!
Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?
No! I won't let you!  You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Uhh…
Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible.
Ah! Aaah! Aaah! Aah- aah!",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Hey, get me down!
Why is it always me?
Harry- I don't know who did it, but you'd better come! Come on!",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Harry- it's Hermione!
I think so.
I'm okay. Okay.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Yeah.
Professor Snape.
Professor Snape.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Y-Yes but I don't want that boggart to turn into her, either.
She carries a red handbag...
Riddikulus!",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Hey!.
Harry. Wherever did you get it?
Go on, Harry!",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"There's the um... The cruciatus curse.
Amazing. Amazing.
Oh, right sorry.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea.
You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!
You know, if you're interested in plants you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity resistant trees?",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"I don't know about a turnip but you can always use gilliweed.
Absolutely.
Most likely.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Well there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of freshwater versus saltwater.
I just wanted to help.
You seem a little tense Harry.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!
Hey, Harry.
But we're all students. None of us has the experience to--",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"What about an unused classroom?
Hey, Harry, what is all this stuff?
Expelliarmus!",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Expelliarmus!
I did it! I did it!
What's wrong with him?",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Expelliarmus!
I can see them too.
Yeah, Harry, don't.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Expelliarmus!
Stupify!
What's they do to her?",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"She's alive, Harry. There's a pulse.
I'll do it. You're better at fighting.
Where do we go?",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Don't do it, Harry! Don't!
You put them in St. Mungos!
Don't give it to them!",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Yeah...
It's Dumbledore!
Which one do I use for the soup?",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Good luck, eh, Ron?
Drink?
I didn't make the cut for the Slug Club.  It's okay.  He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"He's not here, you fools.
I knew you'd come! I told them alii! Harry Potter would never abandon Hogwarts!
Like hell? I reckon. This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You'll see. Hermione! Ron!",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Hey, Ab. There might be a couple more people on the way.
Well? Ready?
That's because it never existed till now. The seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year. This is the only way in or out now. The grounds are crawling with Death Eaters and Dementors.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Hardly ever see him. It's the Carrows you have to watch out for.
Brother and sister. They're in charge of discipline. Like punishment, the Carrows.
Today's Dark Arts lesson had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse. On First Years. I refused. Hogwarts has changed.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Aw, c'mon. Don't be grim. We're all used to it by now. And the thing is, it helps when people stand up, gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry. C'mon, we're almost there.
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?  Hey! Listen up, you lot! I've brought you a surprise!
Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry's back.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Okay, okay! Stand down! lLet's not kill them before You-Know-Who gets the chance!
What is it?
What is it, Ginny?",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Let me get this straight, Professor. You're giving us permission to do this?
To blow it up. Boom.
Wicked.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"You do know what you're doing, don't you, Seamus?
Blimey.
Not good.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Ha! dal
Yeah! You and whose army!
Sorry.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Not good.
Are you bloody joking?!
That was kind of exciting. Seamus grins and winks knowingly. Ginny shakes her head.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Not good.
Never better! Feel like I could spit fire! Haven't seen Luna, have you?
I'm mad for her! Think it's about time I told her, seeing as there's a pretty good chance we'll both be dead by dawn!",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"Don't mention it.
Neville Longbottom.
I'd like to say something.",Good,2,Undead
neville longbottom,"It doesn't matter that Harry is gone. A troubled MURMUR ripples through the crowd.
This isn't over.
Harry! Look out!",Good,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.  This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy.  Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well, soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.
Up!
Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse.",Bad,2,Undead

Is that so?  Have it your way, then!

Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...""the four of us.""
The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are......werewolves!",Bad,2,Undead

You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.
Scared, Potter?!  Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.",Bad,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"HELP!!!!!
I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.
Oh look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend.",Bad,2,Undead

That's right. And that's not all that new this year.
You see Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best.",Bad,2,Undead

Crabbe, Goyle! Where have you two been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Why are you wearing glasses?",Bad,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"Reading?
I didn't know you could read. And what are you doing down here, Weasley?
Well, sit down. You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. What's wrong with you, Crabbe?",Bad,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"You know, I'm surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place.
What? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?
Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin!",Bad,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"You know I don't Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this: It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it-- only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So, it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me, I hope it's Granger. What's the matter with you two? You're acting very…odd.
Hey! Where are you going?
Potter. Is it true you fainted? I mean, you actually fainted?",Bad,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"Exactly how do we do that?
Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
Oh, yeah. Terribly funny. Really Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.",Bad,2,Undead

Oh, please.
Yes you're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!",Bad,2,Undead

Oh You're gonna regret this.
You and your bloody chicken!",Bad,2,Undead

This class is ridiculous.
Well, well. Look who's here. You two shopping for your new dream home? Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee? Don't your family sleep in uh... one room?",Bad,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"Uh, Not very friendly. Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
How dare you talk to me! You filthy little mudblood! Who is that? Don't stand there! Do something!
Get out of the way! Move!",Bad,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"Now I'll tell you. Father said... I can keep the hippogriff's head. I think I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room. This is going to be rich. Look who's here. Come to see the show?
Not a word to anyone, understood?
Not a word to anyone, understood? I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words.",Bad,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"Father and I are in the minister's box, by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself.
Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last
My father will hear about this!",Bad,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"I should thank you, Weasley. You're definitely our best player!
Bet you loved that, Potter! Saved Weasley's neck, didn't you?
I've never seen a worse Keeper! Maybe we should add some more verses to our little song. About his filthy mother!",Bad,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"And his pathetic loser of a father too!
But then, you like the Weasleys, don't you? How can you stand the stink? I guess it reminds you of your own dear mother!
God, I can't wait until all you Weasleys have been expelled. Your stench has been fouling this castle for too long.",Bad,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"That's for speaking to me. You know, you Weasleys are just as bad as Mudbloods!
You know, Weasley, it's really too bad Potter saved you from the Chamber of Secrets.
What just happened?  Blaise?",Bad,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"Hogwarts.  What a pathetic excuse for a school.  I think I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower if I thought I had to continue on for another two years.
Let's just say I don't think you'll be seeing me wasting my time in Charms Class next year.
Amused, Blaise?  We'll see just who's laughing in the end.",Bad,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"You two go on.  I want to check something.
Didn't mummy ever tell you it's bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus!
Oh, right, she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.",Bad,2,Undead

It's a not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick.

Take your hands off me,  you filthy squib!
Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy?",Bad,2,Undead
draco malfoy,"Certainly... Professor.
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't.  What's it to you?
I don't need protection.  I was chosen for this!  Out of all others.  Me!  And I won't fail him.",Bad,2,Undead

Well, well, what brings you here, Potter? Harry looks slowly over his shoulder. Draco -- Blaise and Goyle at his side -- steps INTO VIEW, his face bisected by light. He holds a wand on Harry.",Bad,2,Undead

severus snape,"There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few...  who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper...  in death.  Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.  Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?  You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?
And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane?
Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything...  is it, Mr. Potter?",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Silence.  And put her hand down, you silly girl.  For your information, Potter... asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful, it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.  Well?  Why aren't you all copying this down?  And Gryffindors, note that five points, will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek.
Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin.
What? Oh!",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.
You know perfectly well what I mean.  We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.
Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"You want to be careful. People will think you're  up to something.
You were seen by no less than seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
Silence! I assure you, that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home- tonight. As it is…",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such--
If I might, Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.
Yes, Miss Granger?",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Expelliarmus!
Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor.
Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you.
Vipera evenesca.
A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come, at last.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
I've done the dungeons, headmaster. No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own... completely undetected?",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Any theories on how he managed it?
You may recall... prior to the start of term I expressed concerns... about your appointment of Professor...
What about Potter? Should he be warned?",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Turn to page 394.
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching... at the present time. Turn to page 394.
Quiet.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Now, which one of you can tell me the difference... between an Animagus and a werewolf? No one? How disappointing.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's the second time... you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Are you incapable of restraining yourself... or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
Five points from Gryffindor. As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning... two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis... on recognizing it.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter. Loss of limb will not excuse you. Page 394. The term werewolf... is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word were... which means man, and wolf. Werewolf, man-wolf. There are several ways to become a werewolf. They include being given the power of shape-shifting... being bitten by a werewolf...
Potter. What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Turn out your pockets. Turn out your pockets! What's this?
Really? Open it. Reveal your secrets. Read it.
Go on.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Why, you insolent little...
Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk... in the moonlight, are we?
That remains to be seen. I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise. Clearly, it's full of dark magic.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Expelliarmus! Vengeance is sweet. How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
I told Dumbledore you were helping an old friend into the castle, and now here's the proof.
Give me a reason. I beg you!",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Oh listen to you two, quarreling like an old married couple.
I could do it, you know. But why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you. Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes. A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like. It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
After you.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"There you are, Potter!
Come back here, Potter!
Master I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time being let them unfold.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the black lake was inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?
Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, not something found in your every day garden. Nor is this, know what it is?
Veritaserum. Three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill his darkest secrets. The use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden, however should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing flies? You and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me I'm going to find out why.
Polyjuice potion.
Sit, Potter.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"As you are well aware, I will be teaching you Occlumency. The headmaster feels you should learn this form of magic to defend yourself against the Dark Lord, who is skilled at Legilimency.
Legilimency is the ability to extract thoughts and feelings from others.
As usual, you have all the subtlety of a stone wall, Potter.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"The mind is not a book, of which any page can be examined. The mind is complex and multi-layered.
Yes, it did, but at the expense of our advantage. The connection between you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the Dark Lord became aware of it. The Headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage, to manipulate you through false visions.
Wand out, Potter.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"You may use any spell you can think of to try and repel me.
I am going to break into your mind.
Well, you stopped me eventually. Ideally, you should repel me with your mind.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Clear your mind, Potter. Abandon
What was that?
Realized what, Potter?",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"What did you say?
There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, none of which concern you.
Have you been practicing, Potter?",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Well, we shall see, won't we?
You just wait...
Semper-——",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"I don't need help from a mud-blood like her!
Having fun, Potter?
Been enjoying yourself?",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Amusing man, your father...
You will repeat what you saw to no
You had better not, Potter, or you will experience a pain so horrible you will wish you had never been born!",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Now get out of my sight! Do not set foot in this office ever again!
You wished to see me?
Well, it appears that I cannot help you. I have none.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Potter, if I want nonsense shouted at me, I shall inform you. He sweeps from the office. Umbridge is enraged.
Run along, Wormtail.
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Put it down, Bella.  We mustn't touch what isn't ours. As it so happens I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.
Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. Understandable.
Over the years I have played my part well.  So well I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.  But it might be possible for me to help Draco.  To provide some... protection.
I can try.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Take out your wand.
I will.
I will.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"I will.
It was his father's.
It's alright, Mr. Filch.  I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"What do you think?
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
Indeed.  Your evidence?",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"You... just... know.  Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing.  How grand it must be to be the Chosen One.
What's going on back here?
You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Not so quick, Potter.
... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
Besides, I only wish to convey a message.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"From Professor Dumbledore.  He asked that I give you his best and that he hopes you enjoy your holiday.  You see, he's traveling and won't return until term resumes.
I'll escort him out.
I swore to protect you.  I made the Unbreakable Vow --",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"You're afraid, Draco.  You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you --
Have you ever considered that you ask too much?  That you take too much for granted?  Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?
No!  The Dark Lord was clear.  The boy's to do it.  Go on, Draco. Now!",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"No.
I gave my word.  I made a vow...
Avada Kedavra!",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"You can no longer stay here.
Go on!
Go on!",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Don't ever associate that word and my name again.
No!  He belongs to the Dark Lord!
You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"You may have gotten your mother's eyes, but you're as dim as your father.  Yes.  It's me.  I'm the Half-Blood Prince.
It will happen Saturday next.  At nightfall.
-- from the source we discussed.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"This is a false trail.  The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter. Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry.
To a safehouse.  Likely the home of someone in the Order.  I'm told it has been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him.  We may have compromised the Ministry, but there are those who remain loyal to him.  As long as the Ministry stands, his allies within will have the means at their disposal to insure his safety.
Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this hour. It has come to my attention that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by
For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise. We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter's return to Hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable. Consequently, in the past several months and under my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls. But know this. Should anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Rest assured: So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step foot in this castle.
Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening... I invite them to step forward now.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In the last few hours alone --
There is no wand more powerful. Ollivander himself said it. Tonight, when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I am sure. It answers to you and you only.
My Lord?",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"With you, of course, my Lord.
My Lord --
Take them...",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"Take them!
Please.
They are the same...",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"You have your mother's eyes...
Lily... Then...
She's jealous. Because she's ordinary and you're special.",Good,2,Dead
severus snape,"It's true. You know so yourself.
No! Don't kill me!

You better take this.  Careful now, it's comin' back.  Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater... Uh-oh.

A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.
Can you think of no one?",Good,1,Else

He lies.
Let me speak to him.",Bad,2,Dead

Harry Potter, we meet again.
Yes. You see what I’ve become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can, something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket.",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"Stop him.  Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!
Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back.  All I ask for is something in return.  That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone!
Kill him!",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"Fool! Get the stone!
NO! The boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it WILL be done exactly as I say.
Good. First, gather our old comrades. Send them a sign.",Bad,2,Dead

Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
Let me see it again.",Bad,2,Dead

Kill the spare.

Hold out your arm.
The other arm Wormtail.",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me.
Not even you, Lucius.
There were signs my friend, and more than whispers.",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail.
Oh, such a handsome boy.
Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? It was love. You see when dear sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch you. It was old magic, something I should have forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed, I can touch you now!",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow!
That's better. And now...
Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up.",Bad,2,Dead

Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's mine!
No!",Bad,2,Dead

Can you reach it? Can you take it for me, Black?
Oh, you will die. Eventually. But there are hours, even days of pain awaiting you before then.",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"I'm going to enjoy this, Black. I have you, and soon I shall have the weapon. And then not even your pathetic Order can stand in my way! Voldemort laughs, a horrible spine-chilling laugh.
So, you smashed my prophesy...

Are you burdened?
You bring news I trust, Severus?",Bad,2,Dead

Pius, what say you?
Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.  Where will he be taken?  The boy?",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"Wormtail!  Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?
As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.  But I face an unfortunate complication.  It has recently come to my attention that my wand and Potter's share the same core. They are, in some ways, twins.  We can wound but not fatally harm one another.  Which means, if I am to kill him... I will have to do it with another's wand.
Come now.  Surely one of you would like the honor?  What about... you, Lucius?",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"I require your wand.
Do I detect elm?
And the core?",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"My wand?  You can't possibly think I would give you my wand.
For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Her specialty was Muggle studies. It is Miss Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us.
She would, given her way, have us mate with them.  To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination but something to be encouraged.  I, of course, take a contrary view.  But we're all civilized here.  All adults.  We can agree to disagree.",Bad,2,Dead

Nagini... Dinner.
Avada...",Bad,2,Dead

Perhaps our friend's loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail.
I hope so, Ollivander, for your sake.  I won't be so forgiving next time...",Bad,2,Dead

Who was he?  The thief?
I believe you...",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"I have seen your heart and it is mine...
If not you, then who?
Tell me, Grindelwald.  Tell me where to find it!  Tell me who possesses it!  The name, Grindelwald!  The name!",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. We must find out just how much he knows. We must return to our hiding places and see if the others are safe.
I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think this wise. But this is foily.
I wish you no harm. TI have great respect for the students of Hogwarts. I was once one myself after all. I ask for but one thing and if granted no magical blood shail be spiit...",Bad,2,Dead

They never learn. Such a pity.
Begin.",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"Nagini. Come.
Stop looking at her. She smells your fear. It agitates her. Be grateful she's just eaten.
I do not need to seek the boy! Before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand!",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"How do you live with yourself, Lucius?  Go. Find Severus. Tell him I need to see him immediately.
Why doesn't it work for me?
No! I am extraordinary! But the wand resists me!",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"Does it?
The wand. Does it truly answer to me?
You're a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know.",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"Where, Severus? Where does its loyalty lie?
The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am
The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. Ollivander was quite explicit about that. You killed Dumbledore, Severus. While you live, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine.",Bad,2,Dead

But only I can live forever...
Kill.",Bad,2,Dead

I therefore command my forces to retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured.",Bad,2,Dead

voldemort,"Behold, Nagini. Our work is done.
Stupid girl. You cry for that?
While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only. While you battled courageously, until you could no longer will yourself to stand, he had long since fallen to his knees. While you cursed me until your voices grew ragged, he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek as a child's.",Bad,2,Dead
voldemort,"So do not cry for that. He's not worthy of your tears. And do not despair of his betrayal. You were never in his heart. Not for one single solitary beat.
Did you not hear me! Harry Potter is dead! From this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences. HARRY POTTER Is

Who might you be, young man?",Bad,2,Dead

You were tried by the full court?
Ah...yes...I'm afraid we had a bit of a row. He, well, he sided with Fudge and the rest of us sided with Dumbledore, so Percy left.",Good,2,Undead

Settle down, you three!
Sirius, we saw Fudge talking with Lucius Malfoy on Level Nine again. Tell Dumbledore, next time he comes in, would you?",Good,2,Undead

Come on, Harry!",Good,2,Undead
arthur weasley,"You'll have to forgive Remus.  It takes its toll -- his condition.
We're being followed, all of us. Molly doesn't leave the house most days.  It's not been easy.
Yes, but I thought it best if I replied in person.  If Dumbledore's traveling, it's news to the Ministry.  But perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.  As for Draco Malfoy -- I know a bit more.",Good,2,Undead
arthur weasley,"I sent an agent to Borgin & Burkes.  From what you describe, I think what you and Ron saw at the end of the summer -- the object that Draco seemed so interested in -- was a Vanishing Cabinet.
They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can imagine the appeal. Should the Death Eaters come calling, one needed only slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.  But they're tricky contraptions.  Require a tremendous amount of looking after.  Eventually they fell out of favor.
Nothing.  It's still there.",Good,2,Undead
arthur weasley,"Harry.  You know, I went through all this before -- the last time around.  Times like these -- dark times -- do funny things to people.  It can bring them together and it can tear them apart.  Things... speed up.  It's what happens when you don't know if today will be your last.
Harry, no!
Ginny, stay with your mother!",Good,2,Undead

Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front page! Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me,… which, incidentally is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list, he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving… with my entire collected works, free of charge. Now, ladies?
Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher… me! Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-times winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award- but I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him. Huh, huh, huh… hee, hee… Now- be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind. You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. I must ask you not to scream. It might… provoke them!",Bad,2,Undead

Gather 'round, gather 'round! Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves, as I myself have done on countless occasions- for full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration.

Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they're paying you overtime, but judging by the state of this, I'd say not. What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it.

Really, Potter. You expect to defeat all of us with your little school friends? Now hand it over, and they won't have to die here.
No! If the prophesy is smashed--",Bad,1,Undead

Because I told her to. You'll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girl's bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet.
I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust.",Bad,2,Dead

Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target… has been you. How is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?",Bad,2,Dead

Remarkable isn't it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

Good evening.",Neutral,1,Dead

Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we? Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff known as Buckbeak, hereinafter called the condemned, shall be executed this day at sundown.

Hagrid?
Right. Well, well. We must search the grounds.",Neutral,1,Dead

Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body must be moved Dumbledore, there are... too many people.
You're late.",Neutral,1,Dead

Very well, we are ready to begin.
Ah...you...er...got our message that the time had changed, did you?",Neutral,1,Dead
cornelius fudge,"Well. The...ah...charges.
The charges against the accused shall now be read into the record: That the accused did with deliberation and fore-knowledge of the illegality of his actions, produce a patronus charm in full sight of a Muggle.
Within full sight of a Muggle?",Neutral,1,Dead
cornelius fudge,"It doesn't matter how impressive it was!
Ah, yes, yes, another cock-and-bull story.
Oh, come now, Susan. He's clearly lying.",Neutral,1,Dead

Very well. Weasley, fetch the witness.
Full name?",Neutral,1,Dead

Very well, you may go.
Not very convincing.",Neutral,1,Dead
cornelius fudge,"So two Dementors just happen to be in Little Whinging? I think not...
Yes, and they're nothing but bilge, Dumbledore.
Dementors are irrelevant!",Neutral,1,Dead
cornelius fudge,"Well, yes, if he's telling the truth!
Very well, all for clearing the accused of charges?
All opposed?",Neutral,1,Dead
cornelius fudge,"Certainly.
Well, what about the meeting tonight?
So, Dumbledore, you've been behind this whole thing.",Neutral,1,Dead

I knew it! I KNEW it! You've been plotting against me all this time!
This is too good to be true!",Neutral,1,Dead

I see no snag, Dumbledore.
Resisting arrest, now are you, Dumbledore?",Neutral,1,Dead

Find him!
I know...I saw him too...",Neutral,1,Dead

What's he doing here? And what's happened to him?",Neutral,1,Dead

Hagrid? Is that you?
Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.",Neutral,1,Dead

No! The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler.
We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.",Neutral,1,Dead
aragog,"I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here.

Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby... wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it. You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out. It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out. What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?",Bad,1,Undead

It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. It was searching the train for Sirius Black. If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver. Eat. You'll feel better.
Intriguing, isn't it? Would anyone like to venture a guess... as to what is inside?",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Very good, Mr. Thomas. Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
So terrifying, yes, yes, yes... Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. Let's practice it now. Without wands, please. After me. Riddikulus!
Very good. A little louder and very clear. Listen: Riddikulus!",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Very good. So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough. What really finishes a boggart is laughter. You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. Let me explain. Uh... Neville, would you join me, please? Come on, don't be shy. Come on. Come on. Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Sorry?
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all. And I believe you live with your grandmother.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"No... it won't. I want you to picture her clothes. Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
We don't need to hear. As long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when I open that wardrobe... here's what I want you to do. Excuse me. Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes. Can you do that? Yes. Wand at the ready. One, two, three. Think, Neville, think.
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay... to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line! Form a line! I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most... and turn it into something funny. Next! Ron! Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave! Wand at the ready, Ron, wand at the ready.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Yes! You see? Very good, very good! Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next! Show us what you see. Keep your nerve. Steady.
And next! Step up, step up! Wonderful, wonderful! Here! Riddikulus! Right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today. Collect your books from the back. That's the end of the lesson. Thank you! Sorry! Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes? I would've thought it'd be obvious. I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"I'm very impressed. That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself. This is very wise.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. Our pain becomes their power.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by your scar, by your eyes. They're your mother, Lily's. Yes. Oh, yes. I knew her. Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. Not only was she a singularly gifted witch... she was also an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in others... even, and perhaps most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves. And your father, James, on the other hand... he... He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you. You're more like them than you know, Harry. In time, you'll come to see just how much.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick. Is there no chance of fixing it?
Listen. Dementors are amongst the foulest creatures to walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory... until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. You are not weak, Harry. The dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past. Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Well I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"There was only one that night.
I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. But as the dementors seem to have developed a particular interest in you... perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays. For now, I need to rest.
Harry. There you are. You came. Are you sure about this, Harry? You know this is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Well, everything's prepared. Now, the spell I'm going to try to teach you is called the Patronus Charm. Did you ever hear of it? No? Well... A Patronus is a kind of positive force. For the wizard who conjures one... it works something like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him. But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory. Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this? Yes. Very well. Close your eyes. Concentrate. Explore your past. Do you have a memory? Allow it to fill you up. Lose yourself within it. Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
Very good. Shall we? Wand at the ready.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths. It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time. That would have been remarkable. Here, eat this. You'll feel better.
Oh, no, no, no. That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart. The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse. As a matter of interest, what were you thinking? Which memory did you choose?
That's not good enough. Not nearly good enough.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Is it strong? Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?
Yes! Well done, Harry. Well done!
Yes. Sit down. Here. Eat this, it helps. It really helps. And just so you know, Harry... I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that... is saying something.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Professor!
Harry, are you alright?
Oh, I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks as though it's merely a parchment designed to insult anyone... who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Come in. I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession... but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in. Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black... is a map to you?
Your father never set much store by the rules either. But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. Gambling their sacrifice by wandering around the castle unprotected... with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them! Now, I will not cover up for you again, Harry. Do you hear me?
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. And don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Oh, really? And who might that be?
That's not possible.
Expelliarmus! Well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged, aren't we? Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"I know.
I understand.
How long have you known?",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Well, well, well, Hermione. You really are the brightest witch of your age, I've ever met.
Wait!
Very well. Kill him. But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"No, Harry it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents... but it was somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
Severus don't be a fool.
Sirius be quiet.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Severus, please.
He was at school with us. We thought he was our friend!
No, he didn't. I thought so too, until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the map!",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?
You should've realized, Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would! Together!
Harry, this man...",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Get away from her!
Immobulus!
Hello, Harry. I saw you coming. I've looked worse, believe me.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"No. No. I resigned, actually.
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition. This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want... well, someone like me teaching their children.
Dumbledore has already... risked enough on my behalf. Besides, people like me are... Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
Didn't make any difference? Harry it made all the difference in the world. You have uncovered the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. It made a great deal of difference. If I am proud of anything... it is of how much you have learned this year. Now, since I am no longer your teacher... I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. So now I'll say goodbye, Harry. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Until then... mischief managed.
Harry, douse the light. We're exposed here.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"We're your advanced guard, Harry. Dumbledore just sent us as soon as he heard about the attack. We're taking you to safety. We're just waiting for the all clear.
You didn't think Dumbledore'd let you wander around on your own, did you?
Harry, I don't believe you've met Nymphadora Tonks.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Tonks, would you go get Harry's broom from the house?
Brooms.
On your broom, Harry.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"There's the second signal!
There's the other one, Alastor!
Harry, leave it to us!",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"""Expecto Patronum!'
Get Harry to the safe house!
Stay here, Harry.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Get in, quick, Harry. Don't touch anything.
We're doing our best, but it's proving to be...difficult.
Fudge likes being Minister of Magic. If it turns out that Voldemort came back under his watch, he'll be sacked.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"But Dumbledore is doing all he can.
I'm sorry, Harry, we can't say anything more.
Easy for you to say.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Harry! HARRY!...he's gone...there's nothing you can do...
Harry, no!
Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Has it occurred to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so that he could find out what he's up to?
It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgement. He trusts Snape.  Therefore, I do.
You're blinded by hatred.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"You are!  People are disappearing, Harry.  Daily.  We can only put our trust in a handful of people. If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed.
There's someone out there.  I can smell him.  There's more than one --
Just remember, Fleur, once you're married:  Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"The house!  Quickly!
What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts!
What Creature!",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"We've been betrayed.  Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I had to make sure you weren't an imposter.
Snape. He'll be fine, Molly.  But that's Dark Magic.  The damage is done.
'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.'",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Mad-Eye reckoned You-Know-Who would expect the real Harry to be with the most skilled Auror.  He knew he'd be in the most danger.
Better.
We want you to be the godfather.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Say yes.
Harry!  Go!  Go!
It's the quality of one's conviction that determines success, not the number of one's followers.",Good,2,Dead
remus lupin,"Me.
Speaking of quality.
You shouldn't have. It's Teddy who needs you.",Good,2,Dead

Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. Someday he'll understand...",Good,2,Dead

Harry. I couldn't risk sending Edward. It was since the world cup and the ministry's been intercepting more and more owls and she's too easily recognised. We need to talk Harry. Face to face. Meet me in the Griffindore common room at one o clock this Saturday night and make sure you're alone. P.S....",Good,2,Dead

I don't have much time Harry so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the goblet of fire?

Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry, the deatheaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe any more.",Good,2,Dead

Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this counsel. Should your testimony prove consequential.

Ministry malcontent. And your new defence against the dark arts teacher. I'm here because Dumbledore asked me, end of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? When it comes to the dark arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many unforgivable curses there are?",Good,2,Dead
alastor moody,"And they are so named?
Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now the ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say different! You need to know what you're up against, you need to be prepared, you need to find somewhere else to put your chewing gum other than the underside of your desk Mr Finnigan!
So, which curse shall we see first?",Good,2,Dead
alastor moody,"Give us a curse.
Ahhh yes, your father would know all about that. Gave the ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why.
Hello. What a little beauty.",Good,2,Dead

But if she bites... she's lethal!
What are you laughing at?",Good,2,Dead

Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only do did you-know-whose bidding under the influence of the imperious curse. But here's the rub, how do we sort out the liars? Another.. another.. Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up.
Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology.",Good,2,Dead
alastor moody,"Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly nasty. The torture curse.
Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable curse Miss Granger.
The killing curse. Only one person is known to have survived it. And he's sitting in this room.",Good,2,Dead
alastor moody,"Son. You alright?
Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something.

Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in ther. You wouldn't believe it if I did. Now... what are you going to do about your dragon?
Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, by your age he could take a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have a strategy, and you can bet that it'll play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come on Potter. What are your strengths?",Good,2,Dead

You're allowed a wand.
Hate to break up this scholar session but Professor McGonagall would like to see you in her office. Not you Potter, just Weasly and Granger.",Good,2,Dead

Why don't you help Potter put his books back.
Put that in your mouth.",Good,2,Dead
alastor moody,"Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter into one of the ministry's summer internships are we? Last boy who went into the department of ministries never came out!
And they say I'm mad.
Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest you to know that this conversation is no longer private.",Good,2,Dead
alastor moody,"Yeah took a piece of me with him though didn't he.
Champions! Prepare yourselves.
Are you alright Potter?",Good,2,Dead
alastor moody,"Does it hurt?
I'd better take a look at it.
What was it like? What was he like?",Good,2,Dead
alastor moody,"The dark lord. What was it like to stand in his presence?
Were there others? In the graveyard, were there others?
Marvellous creatures dragons aren't they? Do you think that miserable oaf would have led you into the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would have told you to hold the egg under the water if I hadn't have told him first myself? Do you think Neville Longbottom the witless wonder could have provided you with gilliweed if I hadn't have given him the book that led you straight to it? Huh??",Good,2,Dead
alastor moody,"You won because I made it so Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the dark lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter.

Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you.",Good,2,Dead
alastor moody,"You sneeze and the Ministry will know who wipes your nose.  Point is, we have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect: brooms, thestrals and the like. We'll go in pairs.  That way if anyone's out there waiting for us -- and I reckon there will be -- they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one.
I believe you're familiar with this particular brew.
Everyone here's of age, Potter, and they've all agreed to take the risk.",Good,2,Dead
