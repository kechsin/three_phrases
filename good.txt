Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?
And the boy?
Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this? Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are...
This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.
Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while you’re here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup. The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily.
We're ready for you now. Follow me.
Will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words. When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger.
Draco Malfoy.
Susan Bones. Ronald Weasley.
Harry Potter.
Your attention, please. Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Perhaps if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, that way one of you might be on time.
Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.
Harry Potter?  Follow me. You wait here.
Professor Quirrell, excuse me, excuse me. Could I borrow Wood for a moment, please?
Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker! Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!
Miss Granger?
Be that as it may be...it was an extremely foolish thing to do.  I would have expected more rational behavior on your part, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment.  As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. Five points...will be awarded to each of you.  For sheer dumb luck. Good evening.
Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.
Each.  And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention. No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.
I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.
How do you know ? I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly.
What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?
Not today, Mr. Weasley. But, I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention. Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. Like so. One, two, three, Vera verto. Now it's your turn. Well, who would like to go first? Ah! Mr. Weasley. “One, two, three. Vera verto.”
That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. Yes, Miss Granger?
Well, very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not. Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, “pure-bloods.” Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.
Well, naturally, the school had been searched many times. No such chamber has been found.
Well, the Chamber is said to home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster. I think- do ya know- I think he's been Petrified, Madame Pomfrey. Look! Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker…
What can this mean, Albus?
What should I tell the staff. Oh!
This is out of my hands, Potter.
Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. Sherbet lemon. This match has been cancelled.
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you have to see.
I warn you, this could be a wee bit of a shock. She was found near the Library, along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you?
Could I have your attention please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. “All students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions.” I should tell you this: unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed.
All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second floor corridor, immediately. As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.
Well, that's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are a legend.
Ginny Weasley. Could I have your attention, please?
Now remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege. Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school in anyway that privilege shall not be extended again. No permission form signed, no visiting the village. That's the rule, Potter.
I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign. Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word. Cornelius!
Professor Dumbledore does not want dementors around the place, I can assure you.
Well. Now years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death... You remember? They went into hiding. Few knew where they were. One who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who! Yes, little lump of a boy. Always trailing after Sirius Black.
Well Peter Pettigrew tried to warn the Potters... and might have managed to, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Yes. Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters, but he's the reason they're dead. Mhmm.
This: Sirius Black was... and remains to this day... Harry Potter's godfather!
Little lump of a boy. Always trailing after Sirius Black. This can't go on Albus. First the dark mark, now this?
Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.
Well the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accomodate them... Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy not a piece of meat.
Professor Moody what are you doing?
Is that a student? We never use transfigration as a punishment, surely Dumbledore told you that.
Well you will do well to remember it.
The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. As representitives of the host school I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance. Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.
Now to dance is to let the body breathe, inside every girl a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight.
Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join me. Now, place your right hand on my waist.
My waist.
Now bend your arm. Mr Filch... One two three, one two three, one two three.
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet. Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?
To dance. It's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance. Surely I told you that.
Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great hall with Miss Patil. Good. Off you go.
Potter!
Where on earth are you going at this time of night? What?
Yes, I think you might be right, Potter. She looks at Harry.
Well, give her to me. I'll run her There you are.
Bear in mind, Potter, that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts are being watched, won't you?
Good. Now, off to bed. My office. Now.
In all my thirty-nine years at this school, I have never seen such a disgusting display.
Of course he wanted to provoke you! He'd just lost! I cannot express in words the disappointment I feel right now.
What is it, Dolores?
You thought wrong. Now kindly remove yourself from my office. Now, I don't care what Malfoy said. Your performance out there was shameful. Fifty points from Gryffindor, and I'm giving you both a week's worth of detentions.
My hands are tied, Potter.
Potter! Wake up, Potter. Wake up. Please...
You dreamed this, Potter?
You're sure this happened, Potter? We're going to see the Headmaster, Potter.
Well, Potter has had some kind of nightmare...
Yes, we're fine. History of Magic is up, ladies, not down.  Mr. Davies -- that's the girl's toilet...
Potter!
Enjoying ourself, are we? So I noticed.  I would think you'd want to fill it with Potions.  Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?
And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with 'Exceeds Expectations.'
Good.  And take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there. You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the Three Broomsticks, Leanne?
Did she say to whom?
All right, Leanne.  You may go. Why is it always you three?  Hm? When something happens? Severus. Is this it?
Yes.  She was cursed.
That's a very serious accusation, Potter. I suggest you return to your dormitory.  All of you.
I think we all agree that Mr. Potter's actions were heroic.  The question is:  Why were they necessary.
To your Houses.  No dawdling. Potter.
Potter, in light of what's happened... should you feel the need to talk to someone...
You should know... Professor Dumbledore... You meant a great deal to him. Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.
No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.
Sorry 'bout that. Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.  Boy, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!
Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself.  Words and all. Heh.
It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it? Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts.
No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?
You're a wizard, Harry. A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.
Well, just Harry. Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared?  Ah.
A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter? It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?
Non magic folk.  This boy's had his name down ever since he was born!  He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore. Never, insult Albus Dumbledore, in front of me.
Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off.  Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm? Essential bit of equipment, Harry.
Well, they don't mean for a penguin, do they? Heh. Crikey, but not a dragon.
Fast and misunderstood beasts, Harry. Fast and misunderstood. If you know where to go.
No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.
Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh.
See, Harry, you're famous!
I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry.  Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.  Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry. Well, there's your money, Harry.  Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.
They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me.  Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.
Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. There's the little devil.  Oh, and there's something else as well.  Professor Dumbledore gave me this.  It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing now, did ya?
Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.
Best not mention this to anyone, Harry. A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.  No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.
Harry! Harry! Happy birthday!
You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet. First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...
No, I can't spell it. All right.  Voldemort.
Shh!! It was dark times, Harry, dark times.  Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em.  Nobody...not one. ‘Cept you.
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.
Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're the boy who lived. What're you looking at?  Blimey, is that the time? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his- well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket.  Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.
Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!
Hello, Harry. Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.
Well done!
What's going on with Harry's broomstick? Go go go!
Looks like he's gonna be sick!
Yes! Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry’s broom?
Who told you ‘bout Fluffy?
Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the.. Shouldn’t have said that. No more questions! Don’t ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.
Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel. I shouldn't said that. I should not have said that.
Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today.
Oh. Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?
Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!
You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today. That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.  Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that.  Oh!  Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
That? It's a ... its um...
I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact. Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert.
Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?  Don't you, Norbert?  Dededede.
Ohh!  Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course.  Who's that? Oh, dear.
Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.
Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?  What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all. Right. Let's go.
What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something.  So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.
And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward.
Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry?
I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up. Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, "After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."
Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, "The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."
I shouldn't have told you that. Where you going?! Wait! Yes!
Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.
Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja?  This is for you. Oh. Go on...on with you.  Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.
I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh?  Off you go.
Harry? What do you think you're doing down 'ere? Come on!
Yer a mess, Harry. Skulkin' 'round Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place! Don' want no one ter see you there. People'll think you were up to no good.
Me? Oh, I was… um… I was lookin' for Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. They're ruinin' all the school cabbages. Hello, Hermione!
You'll be all right now then, Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it, then.
Wo, this calls for a specialist's equipment. Nothin' to do but wait'll it stops, I'm afraid. Better out than in. Who's Ron tryin' to curse, anyway?
He did not!
See, the thing is, Harry, there're some wizards, like the Malfoy family, who think they're better'n everyone else because they're what people call “pure blood.” And it's codswallop, to boot. “Dirty blood.” Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half blood or less. More ter the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can' do. Come here… Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't you think on it for one minute… eh?
Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger! That's been tampered with, that has!
Broken? There's no bones left! Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry!
In fact, I'd be prepared ter swear it in front o' the Ministry of Magic!
Well, of course you don't, and… Oh… Oh, right. Well, I'll, umhum. I'll just wait outside, then. Let's get yeh out of there.
You can't! You don't understand.
It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one! Never! No!
No!
Aragog! Aragog! Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me now, would ya?
Oh, It's a- Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, ya know. Now, accordin' to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit o' growing up to do. But, once their acne's cleared up, we'll be able to chop 'em up and stew 'em, and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified. In the meantime, though, you three had best be lookin' after yourselves. All right? Hmm.
Hello, Neville! Who's there? Hello? Hello?
Oh, nothing. I- I was expecting, ah… It doesn't matter- come on inI just made a pot o' tea.
I'm fine! I'm alright. Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all righ'.
What you had to understand about that is—  Quick under the cloak. Don't say a word. Be quiet, both o' you… Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Of course! Come in! Come in. Oh, but I never- you know I never, Professor!
Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban Prison?
What're you doin' here? Get outta my house! Yeh can' take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! You mark my words, there'll be killin's next!
Ahem! If, uh, if anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yup! That would lead them right! That's all I have to say. Oh, and someone'll need to feed Fang while I'm away.
Sorry I'm late! The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And I'd just like to say that aif it hadn't been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione, o' course, I woulduh- I'd still be you-know-where, so I- I'd just like to say 'Thanks.' Oh!
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer. Less talking, if you don't mind. I got a real treat for you today. A great lesson. So follow me. Right, you lot. Less chattering. Form a group over there. And open your books to page 49.
Just stroke the spine, of course. Goodness me. Isn't he beautiful? Say hello to Buckbeak.
That, Ron, is a hippogriff. First thing you wanna know about hippogriffs is that they're very proud creatures. Very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff. It may just be the last thing you ever do. Now, who'd like to come and say hello? Well done, Harry. Well done. Come on now. Now... you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So... step up. Give him a nice bow. Then you wait and see if he bows back. If he does, you can go and touch him. If not... Well, we'll get to that later. Just make your bow. Nice and low. Back off, Harry. Back off. Keep still. Keep still. Well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you. Right. I think you can go and pat him now. Go on. Don't be shy. Nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow. Not so fast, Harry. Slow down, Harry. That's it... Nice and slow. Now let him come to you. Slowly, now, slowly, slowly... That's it... Yes! Well done! Well done, Harry, well done! I think he may let you ride him now.
Come on. Put you over here, just behind the wing joint. Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that. Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
Well done, well done. How am I doing me first day?
Malfoy, no... No! Buckbeak! Whoa, whoa, whoa... Whoa! Buckbeak! Away, you silly creature! Calm down! It's just a scratch!
I'm the teacher. I'll do it.
Class dismissed! Allow me, minister.
Sorry about that.
Well, first off, the committee members took turns... talking about why we were there. And then I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak... was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. And then Lucius Malfoy got up. Well, you can imagine. He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature... who would kill you as soon as look at you. And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
No, I'm not sacked. Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them. They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore... would get into trouble. He's coming down, you know? Dumbledore. Says he wants to be with me when they... When it happens. Great man, Dumbledore. A great man.
You'll do no such thing! Think I want you seeing something like that? No. You just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron...
Keep a closer eye on your pets, Ron. Blimey! What was that?
Oh, crikey.
It's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here. Someone sees you outside the castle at this time of night, you'll be in trouble. Big trouble. Particularly you, Harry. With you in a moment! Quick. Quick! Go on, go on!
Professor Dumbledore.
Minister. Just make your way through. Have a tea, if you like. Dear, dear...
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Keep a closer eye on your pet, Ron. Buckbeak.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
Clear the runway. No... No.
Did you bring your father's cloak like I asked you?
You'll see soon enough. Pay attention this is important. As a matter of fact I have. You might like to try the same thing now and again.
Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on.
Bonsoir Olympe. Couldn't forget you Olympe.
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.
Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood creatures. Although, I have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you know.
Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped bring him over from Romania. Didn't Ron tell you that?
I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well, she left when I was about three. No, not the maternal sort her, broke my dad's heart though. You know he was a tiny little fellow my dad, I could pick him up with one hand by the age of six and put him up in the dresser. And then he died when I was still in school. So I had to make me own way as it were. But enough of me, what about you!
So I remember, I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded me of myself a little. And here we all are, four years later.
Maybe. But we've all got each other, and Harry of course. Soon to be! The youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's ever been! Hooray! I've fine, I tell yeh!
Can' answer tha', I'm afraid. Top secret, that is. Business of the Order.
Oh. Well, yeah, I was, then. Went with Madame Maxime. Took us a month to get to their camp. O' course! Can' do magic, not with the Ministry followin' us all the way. Plus, giants aren't fond o' wizards. Don' trust 'em.
Well, not righ' away. We brought our message, an' I expec' a fair few'll remember it afore teh end comes.
Its jus' up ahead, here. All righ'. Well, I'm showin' yeh this, because tha' Umbridge woman put me on probation. I can' last much longer afore I get sacked like Trelawney.
Knew yeh'd say yes!
Okay, real quiet like from here on. There we are!
None o' them did, Hermione! I didn' have much ruddy choice inna matter! I couldn' leave 'im!
He's me brother! Well, half-brother anyway. Me mum had 'im afore she died.
Here. I'll introduce yeh to Grawp!
Yeh all righ', Grawp? Look wha' I brough' yeh, Grawpy! Two new friends an' all. We 'ave Harry Potter here, see? An' over here is Hermy.
Bad Grawpy! Bad boy!
We don' attack our friends, Grawpy! See, he don' know any better.
Anyway, all yeh need teh do is go an' talk to 'im. Give 'ima bit o' company.
Oh blimey... S'not up to you who comes and goes in this forest.
Stopped yeh from committin' murder, yeh mean!
Well, you'll tolerate 'im as long as he's here! Hey, you three!
Stinksap.  Burn the whiskers right off yer chin.  Trees 'ere are drippin' with it.
It's not fer me.  It's fer Aragog. Yeh remember Aragog, don' yeh? Tha's the one.  He's taken ill. I'm hopin' ter nurse 'im back. Keep yer fingers crossed.
Get back!  All o' yeh!
Now, now.  Now, now... Don' go touchin' tha' but by the wrappin's.  Unnerstan'?
'Arry.  'Orace.
Kill 'im! Me oldest friend, 'e was! Ah, don' worry yerself.  Yer not alone.  Seriously misunderstood creatures -- spiders.  It's the eyes, I reckon.  Unnerve people.
I reckon that too... How'd yeh get outta the castle anyways?
Don' suppose it's doin' 'im any good, izzit? Wish yeh coulda seen 'im in 'is prime.  Magnificent 'e was.  Jus' magnificent...
Aragog.
Tha' was... tha' was... beautiful. To the place he'd known as a lad, They laid him to rest with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two, which was sad...
I had 'im from an egg, yeh know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.  No bigger'n a Pekinese.
Tha's odd. No idea... no idea at all...
Take more'n tha' ter finish me off.  Not sure about me 'ouse, tho'.  But if anybody can put it righ', Dumbledore can.
Only thing I can't reckon is wha' Snape was doin' with tha' lot. An' wha's this wi' the Dark Mar'? Who's been killed? Where's Dumbledore, 'arry? Where's Dumbledore!!
All righ', 'arry?  Yeh look fit.
Brought yeh here sixteen years ago when you were barely bigger than a Bowtruckle. Seems only righ' I should be the one ter take yeh away. Can't do it, 'arry.  My job's ter get you where we're goin' safe 'n sound -- Mad-Eye's orders!
Dragon fire!
Hol' tight, 'arry!  We've got ter get yeh out of here! They were on us from the star', Molly -- the Death Eaters.  And You-Know-Who as well.
Haven't go' any brandy, have yeh, Molly?  Fer medicinal purposes?
Someone else is back. Wha'?  One of us?  Tha's mad.  I'd wager me life it wasn' none of you lot.  An' if it was me I'd kno', wouldn' I?  Talk in me sleep on occasion, I'll admit, but there's only Fang aroun' ter hear an' mostly it's gibberish an' besides I'd cut me tongue out 'fore 'd betray 'arry e'en in me dreams --
Wha's so funny!
'Ear, 'ear. I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands.  Ah. Here we are.  Well, give it a wave.  Apparently not.  Perhaps this.  No, no, definitely not! No matter...  I wonder.  Curious, very curious.
I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar.
Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great. No!  No!  I believed a different wand would work, I swear!
But it makes no sense...
No!  There must be a way!  I'll think of something else! There's no way out of here. We've tried everything. It's enchanted.
Forgive me if I don't get up.
Anything, m'boy, anything. Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange.
Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has changed. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.
There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist --
He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There's no guarantee he will find it -- He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true, what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance. It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course.
Come on. Platform 9¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first.
Fred, you next. Oh, I'm sorry, George.
How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.  Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you dear. Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could have died! You could have been seen! Of course, I don't blame you, Harry dear. Well, you'd best hope that I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are Harry. Now tuck in! That's it. There we go.
Yes dear. It was on the cat.
Morning Arthur! This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
Arthur!
Well, that'll be Errol with the post. Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please? Oh, no.
We'll manage. There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley.
Right. Here we are Harry, you go first dear. Oh, well you go first Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes. In you go… That's it.
You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That's it, mind your head. That's right. Now take your Floo powder. That's it, very good. Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly.
What did he say, dear? I thought he did.
Oh, Harry! Thank goodness! We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far…
Ah! Here he is! Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That's it, Ron.
The train will be leaving any moment!
Okay. Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry!
Harry.
Good to see you, dear. You got everything you need?
Yes? All of your books?
All of your clothes? Good boy.
Quick. Quick. Ron, Ron! Oh, for goodness' sake! Don't lose him!
Hello, Harry dear. Sirius, the meeting is about to start!
Harry, dear, go on upstairs-— quietly, if you please. They're all up there.
You can come down now, the meeting's over. Arthur-
And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young--
It's not your decision! He's not an adult either!
I only have Harry's best interests at heart.
Who else does he have, then? Morning, dear! Did you have a good sleep?
Good luck, Harry!
You're worse than Fred and George. Harry who?
I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?
I seriously doubt that. But why didn't you tell us you were coming?
That man.  But then, what would we do without him?  Ron!
Eat up, eat up, everyone!  There's more to come! You're sure you won't stay?
Remus...?
Harry!  Hagrid!  What happened?! Have you seen the others? Well, thank goodness you two are all right.
My boy!  My darling boy!  What've they done to you?!
Back off, boys! She's mine!  You will never touch my chiidren again! He's not Fred, I am!
We got Potter! We got Potter!
Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch. But they'll turn up in a month or two!
Do you like yours, Ron?  Ron?
Go, go, go, go! Right!
Yeah, Mum would never know.
Morning, Dad. Oh, it…
Not flashing that clipping again are you Ron?
': No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The Cook. The bloke who fixed the toilet. And that wizard from Belgium. Yeah, come on Ron, let's walk you off the astronomy tower and see what you look like.
But not clever enough. Besides, we've got a better way.
We know. Don't worry. We'll get you there. We'll show you a quicker way. If you pipe down. Now, Harry.
Come and join the big boys.
It's a wrench giving it to you believe me. But we've decided your needs are greater than ours. I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
We owe them so much.
In his study. Does that a lot.
Everyone.
What they're doing. Of every day.
Now listen, there are seven secret passageways... out of the castle. We'd recommend
This one. It'll lead you straight to Honeyduke's seller.
Oh and Harry don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
Mischief managed. Otherwise, anyone can read it. Did not.
It's a portkey.
Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron. Feet off the table.
Come on!
Here come the Bulgarians! Krum!!!
Yes!
Viktor I love you! Viktor I do! When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!
Thank you thank you, well lads we've done it. That's why it's so brilliant.
Ready Fred?
You said.. We knew you wouldn't die Harry.
Or an arm.
Never. Well done 'moral fibre'.
Right you are, Fred.
Dumbledore believes he is. Might be able to.
Time we did some real damage to this place.
Unless they spread, in which case, I'd get out of the castle for a while. And now, we've got to go!
You know, I don't think we are.
Completely, Fred. Definitely.
Accio brooms!
Yeah, don't bother writing. Step up!  Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancy...
And just in time for school... Into the cauldron, handsome.
Pocket that and you'll pay in more than Galleons, my friend.
Bloody urchins. Yes, they do really work.
Five Galleons.
Five Galleons. Dead ugly.
Yeah, imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as scrawny, specky gits forever.
Wow -- we're identical! Don't have something a bit more sporty, do you?
Saint-like.
Saint-like... You see, I'm holy. Holey, Fred, geddit? Reckon I'm still better-looking than you.  Better-looking than Bill, that's for sure.
Morning.
Bloody hell, what's the Minister of Magic doing here? Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother.
I'm only joking. I am Fred.
We got Potter! We got Potter! Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!
Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally...
Come on. Right.
Come on. Okay, come on. Shh! Shh! Ok, come on. Shh! Come on.
Morning, Dad. Oh, it…
This lot won't come cheap, Mum. The spell books alone are very expensive.
And not to mention, they're dead scared that Harry'll Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him. Not flashing that clipping again are you Ron?
': No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The Cook. The bloke who fixed the toilet. And that wizard from Belgium.
Peaky? What do you expect? He fell over 100 feet. You gave us a right good scare there, mate.
Clever, Harry.
We know. Don't worry. We'll get you there. We'll show you a quicker way. If you pipe down. Oh. Bless him.
Come and join the big boys.
What's this rubbish? he says. That there it's the secret to our success. George, if you will.
Dumbledore.
Pacing. Everyone.
Where they are.
Every minute. Knicked it from Filch's office, of course. First year.
This one.
The One-Eyed Witch passageway. You best hurry. Filch is heading this way.
Mischief managed. Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Did not. That isn't just any old manky boot mate.
Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.
Feet off the table. It's the Irish!
Krum!!!
Viktor I love you! Viktor I do! When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
Sounds like the irish have got their pride on.
Wicked. Cooked it up just this morning.
Oh yeah? And why's that Granger.
So? Ready George?
Lose a leg.
Pack it in altogether. Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosey sods listening in.
Try saying that five times faster.
Never. All that moral fibre eh?
George, remember that concept. Vomiting Toilet.
Hear, hear! Can't forget that he saved the Sorcerer's Stone from You-Know-Who in his first year.
Just give us a few seconds.
It's been too quiet around here Right. You've got ten minutes to get to Umbridge's office. And whatever you do, stay away from the Astronomy Tower for the next couple of hours.
That was worth it!
Thank you for playing, one and all. Fairly amusing, yeah.
This was never your school! Hogwarts is Dumbledore's school!
George, I think we've outgrown full- time education. Wouldn't you agree? Time to enter the real world?
Accio brooms!
We won't be seeing you. Be sure to visit us at our new premises on Diagon Alley!
Step up!  Step up!
Nosebleed Nougats... Puking Pastilles!
Into the cauldron, handsome.
What'd you think, Harry? We've got eyes in the back of our heads.
A real money spinner that.
Handy if you need to make a quick escape.  Hello, ladies! Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own.
Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?
Aren't they now.  Pygmy Puffs. Can't breed them fast enough. Five Galleons.
Five Galleons.
Ten Galleons. Wasn't always this handsome.
Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.
Have a lot of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye? Just trying to defuse the tension.
Wow -- we're identical!
Yes, don't fancy this color at all. How do you feel, Georgie?
Come again?
With the whole wide world of ear- related humor at your disposal, you go for holey?  Pathetic. Brilliant!
Nice night for it! Good luck.
Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
Leave him alone. Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didn't mean to! Riddle made me, and… Harry, you're hurt!
The Fat Lady! She's gone!
Think you're in love Ron? I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.
Someone here does. Everyone looks at her. She is staring directly at Harry.
And you fought off those dementors that attacked you this summer. I think it should be Dumbledore's Army. There is excited agreement. Harry smiles at her.
We heard Harry yelling. What's up?
Anything we can do to help? We can do that! Me and Luna'll guard the hallway.
What now, Harry?
The Ministry closed a half-hour ago. I expect they all went home. Now where?
I think my ankle's broken. And somebody hit Ron with a weird spell...
Hedwig...?  Mum! Exactly.  How'd you guess?
I'm joking, Mum.
Now you're joking.  I was only wondering when Harry got here. Harry Dimpleton.  Harry Potter, of course.
Well his trunk's in the kitchen. And his owl.
Me, nosy.  Is he up there with you? Harry's.  Haven't seen him, have you?  Apparently, he's wandering about the house.
Meaning?
None of your business. Please.  What's a Wrackspurt?
He's covered in blood again.  Why is it he's always covered in blood?
Shut It! Piss off, Cormac.  How 'bout I toss you a floater?
Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
That's what it says.  Right here. 'This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.' Sorry, I'm not ordinarily late --
What's gotten into him?
Open up, you. Don't trust me?
'Course 'tis.  Made them myself.
Everyone gone to bed? I don't sleep these days.  So I wash my hair.  Silly, right?
Happy Christmas, Harry.
Oh my god... No, Harry!  It's a trap!
'Bout time, don't you think?
You have to get rid of it.  Today. Take my hand.
Over the years, if someone had a secret, if they wanted to conceal something, this is where they came.  Some of these things are almost as old as the castle itself.
Fred and George.  First year.  I hid Tom Riddle's diary here for a time.  Wish I'd left it... What was that?
See, you never know what you'll find up here.
All right.  Close your eyes.  That way you can't be tempted. There's something else.  Another secret of sorts.  One of mine...
That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.
Ron and Tonks should've already been back.  Dad and Fred as well. Oh my God!  George!
Remus!  What're you doing!
Were you going to tell me? And Ron and Hermione.  They'll not be going back to Hogwarts either?
I see.
Zip me up, will you. Seems silly, doesn't it?  A wedding.  Given everything that's going on.
Harry.
Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade. Ready!?
What?
Mad. The both of you. I know.
It's all right. We're going to get you inside.
Don't worry. I won't leave you. I promise. Who's that?
... Hagrid's carrying?
Neville, who is that? No... NO! Trevor!  Sorry.
Seamus, that picture's moving!
The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten. Oh...
AHH!
Down! Down! Ahhhh! Help!!!
AHH!
Help! Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh!  Oh. Ah...help!  Ahh!
Owowowow.
Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying. Gryffindor!
How? I can barely stand at all!
No, that's all I need... you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire! Hey, wait, where are you going? What about the counter-curse?!
Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?
No! I won't let you!  You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you. Uhh…
Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible.
Ah! Aaah! Aaah! Aah- aah! Hey, get me down!
Why is it always me?
Harry- I don't know who did it, but you'd better come! Come on! Harry- it's Hermione!
I think so.
I'm okay. Okay. Yeah.
Professor Snape.
Professor Snape. Y-Yes but I don't want that boggart to turn into her, either.
She carries a red handbag...
Riddikulus! Hey!.
Harry. Wherever did you get it?
Go on, Harry! There's the um... The cruciatus curse.
Amazing. Amazing.
Oh, right sorry. Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea.
You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!
You know, if you're interested in plants you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity resistant trees? I don't know about a turnip but you can always use gilliweed.
Absolutely.
Most likely. Well there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of freshwater versus saltwater.
I just wanted to help.
You seem a little tense Harry. Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!
Hey, Harry.
But we're all students. None of us has the experience to-- What about an unused classroom?
Hey, Harry, what is all this stuff?
Expelliarmus! Expelliarmus!
I did it! I did it!
What's wrong with him? Expelliarmus!
I can see them too.
Yeah, Harry, don't. Expelliarmus!
Stupify!
What's they do to her? She's alive, Harry. There's a pulse.
I'll do it. You're better at fighting.
Where do we go? Don't do it, Harry! Don't!
You put them in St. Mungos!
Don't give it to them! Yeah...
It's Dumbledore!
Which one do I use for the soup? Good luck, eh, Ron?
Drink?
I didn't make the cut for the Slug Club.  It's okay.  He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo. He's not here, you fools.
I knew you'd come! I told them alii! Harry Potter would never abandon Hogwarts!
Like hell? I reckon. This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You'll see. Hermione! Ron! Hey, Ab. There might be a couple more people on the way.
Well? Ready?
That's because it never existed till now. The seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year. This is the only way in or out now. The grounds are crawling with Death Eaters and Dementors. Hardly ever see him. It's the Carrows you have to watch out for.
Brother and sister. They're in charge of discipline. Like punishment, the Carrows.
Today's Dark Arts lesson had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse. On First Years. I refused. Hogwarts has changed. Aw, c'mon. Don't be grim. We're all used to it by now. And the thing is, it helps when people stand up, gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry. C'mon, we're almost there.
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?  Hey! Listen up, you lot! I've brought you a surprise!
Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry's back. Okay, okay! Stand down! lLet's not kill them before You-Know-Who gets the chance!
What is it?
What is it, Ginny? Let me get this straight, Professor. You're giving us permission to do this?
To blow it up. Boom.
Wicked. You do know what you're doing, don't you, Seamus?
Blimey.
Not good. Ha! dal
Yeah! You and whose army!
Sorry. Not good.
Are you bloody joking?!
That was kind of exciting. Seamus grins and winks knowingly. Ginny shakes her head. Not good.
Never better! Feel like I could spit fire! Haven't seen Luna, have you?
I'm mad for her! Think it's about time I told her, seeing as there's a pretty good chance we'll both be dead by dawn! Don't mention it.
Neville Longbottom.
I'd like to say something. It doesn't matter that Harry is gone. A troubled MURMUR ripples through the crowd.
This isn't over.
Harry! Look out! Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.
Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrell’s job for years.
Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer? Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep up. Thank you.
This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change.
Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. Caput Draconis.  Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on.
Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boy's dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.
Gryffindors, keep up please. And stay alert! Errol…
Oh look, it's our Hogwarts letters. And they've sent us Harry's as well.
Hello, Sir Nicholas! Excuse me.
I happen to be a school prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at this time of night. What are your names again?
Mind your attitude, Malfoy. Let me through, please. Excuse me! I'm Head Boy! Get back, all of you. No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours. Back to your common room. Be quiet.
The headmaster's here. You heard. Move!
Mind where you're going! Slow down! You listen! I'm Head Boy! Come back here!
Minister, I saw him! You-Know-Who! He was right there! Oh, yes... of course. There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few...  who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper...  in death.  Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.  Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?  You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?
And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane?
Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything...  is it, Mr. Potter? Silence.  And put her hand down, you silly girl.  For your information, Potter... asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful, it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.  Well?  Why aren't you all copying this down?  And Gryffindors, note that five points, will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek.
Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin.
What? Oh! You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.
You know perfectly well what I mean.  We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.
Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this? You want to be careful. People will think you're  up to something.
You were seen by no less than seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
Silence! I assure you, that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home- tonight. As it is… Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such--
If I might, Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.
Yes, Miss Granger? Expelliarmus!
Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor.
Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps? Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you.
Vipera evenesca.
A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come, at last. Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
I've done the dungeons, headmaster. No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own... completely undetected? Any theories on how he managed it?
You may recall... prior to the start of term I expressed concerns... about your appointment of Professor...
What about Potter? Should he be warned? Turn to page 394.
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching... at the present time. Turn to page 394.
Quiet. Now, which one of you can tell me the difference... between an Animagus and a werewolf? No one? How disappointing.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's the second time... you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Are you incapable of restraining yourself... or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
Five points from Gryffindor. As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning... two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis... on recognizing it. Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter. Loss of limb will not excuse you. Page 394. The term werewolf... is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word were... which means man, and wolf. Werewolf, man-wolf. There are several ways to become a werewolf. They include being given the power of shape-shifting... being bitten by a werewolf...
Potter. What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle. Turn out your pockets. Turn out your pockets! What's this?
Really? Open it. Reveal your secrets. Read it.
Go on. Why, you insolent little...
Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk... in the moonlight, are we?
That remains to be seen. I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise. Clearly, it's full of dark magic. Expelliarmus! Vengeance is sweet. How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
I told Dumbledore you were helping an old friend into the castle, and now here's the proof.
Give me a reason. I beg you! Oh listen to you two, quarreling like an old married couple.
I could do it, you know. But why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you. Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes. A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like. It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
After you. There you are, Potter!
Come back here, Potter!
Master I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time being let them unfold. Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the black lake was inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?
Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, not something found in your every day garden. Nor is this, know what it is?
Veritaserum. Three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill his darkest secrets. The use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden, however should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice. Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing flies? You and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me I'm going to find out why.
Polyjuice potion.
Sit, Potter. As you are well aware, I will be teaching you Occlumency. The headmaster feels you should learn this form of magic to defend yourself against the Dark Lord, who is skilled at Legilimency.
Legilimency is the ability to extract thoughts and feelings from others.
As usual, you have all the subtlety of a stone wall, Potter. The mind is not a book, of which any page can be examined. The mind is complex and multi-layered.
Yes, it did, but at the expense of our advantage. The connection between you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the Dark Lord became aware of it. The Headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage, to manipulate you through false visions.
Wand out, Potter. You may use any spell you can think of to try and repel me.
I am going to break into your mind.
Well, you stopped me eventually. Ideally, you should repel me with your mind. Clear your mind, Potter. Abandon
What was that?
Realized what, Potter? What did you say?
There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, none of which concern you.
Have you been practicing, Potter? Well, we shall see, won't we?
You just wait...
Semper-—— I don't need help from a mud-blood like her!
Having fun, Potter?
Been enjoying yourself? Amusing man, your father...
You will repeat what you saw to no
You had better not, Potter, or you will experience a pain so horrible you will wish you had never been born! Now get out of my sight! Do not set foot in this office ever again!
You wished to see me?
Well, it appears that I cannot help you. I have none. Potter, if I want nonsense shouted at me, I shall inform you. He sweeps from the office. Umbridge is enraged.
Run along, Wormtail.
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak. Put it down, Bella.  We mustn't touch what isn't ours. As it so happens I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.
Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. Understandable.
Over the years I have played my part well.  So well I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time. Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.  But it might be possible for me to help Draco.  To provide some... protection.
I can try. Take out your wand.
I will.
I will. I will.
It was his father's.
It's alright, Mr. Filch.  I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy. What do you think?
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
Indeed.  Your evidence? You... just... know.  Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing.  How grand it must be to be the Chosen One.
What's going on back here?
You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen. Not so quick, Potter.
... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
Besides, I only wish to convey a message. From Professor Dumbledore.  He asked that I give you his best and that he hopes you enjoy your holiday.  You see, he's traveling and won't return until term resumes.
I'll escort him out.
I swore to protect you.  I made the Unbreakable Vow -- You're afraid, Draco.  You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you --
Have you ever considered that you ask too much?  That you take too much for granted?  Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?
No!  The Dark Lord was clear.  The boy's to do it.  Go on, Draco. Now! No.
I gave my word.  I made a vow...
Avada Kedavra! You can no longer stay here.
Go on!
Go on! Don't ever associate that word and my name again.
No!  He belongs to the Dark Lord!
You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? You may have gotten your mother's eyes, but you're as dim as your father.  Yes.  It's me.  I'm the Half-Blood Prince.
It will happen Saturday next.  At nightfall.
-- from the source we discussed. This is a false trail.  The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter. Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry.
To a safehouse.  Likely the home of someone in the Order.  I'm told it has been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him.  We may have compromised the Ministry, but there are those who remain loyal to him.  As long as the Ministry stands, his allies within will have the means at their disposal to insure his safety.
Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this hour. It has come to my attention that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade. I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by
For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise. We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter's return to Hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable. Consequently, in the past several months and under my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls. But know this. Should anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Rest assured: So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step foot in this castle.
Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening... I invite them to step forward now. You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In the last few hours alone --
There is no wand more powerful. Ollivander himself said it. Tonight, when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I am sure. It answers to you and you only.
My Lord? With you, of course, my Lord.
My Lord --
Take them... Take them!
Please.
They are the same... You have your mother's eyes...
Lily... Then...
She's jealous. Because she's ordinary and you're special. It's true. You know so yourself.
No! Don't kill me!
Yes. Only what I heard. But now... he thinks it refers to her.
Yes! But he thinks it's her son! He intends to hunt them down now! To kill them!
I have asked. She's more than that! She's different! Beautiful. Kind.
Anything.
You said you would keep her safe! He doesn't need protection. The Dark Lord has gone --
No one can know. Your word.
He exhibits no measurable talent. His arrogance rivals even his father's. And he seems to relish his fame. You see what you want to see.
Why did you put it on? Surely you realized it carried a curse.
Drink the rest. It will contain the curse to the hand for the time being. It will spread.
Maybe a year.
It is not expected that he will succeed. You ask too much.
Tell him what?
So when the time comes, the boy must die. You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
Expecto Patronum!
Always... We GO TO BLACK... Good afternoon, class.
Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon.  Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, up!
With feeling! Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end.  When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...
Mr. Longbottom.
M-M-Mr. Longbottom! Mr. Longbottom! Mr. Longbottom!
Come back down this instant!
Mr. Longbottom-! Everyone out of the way!  Come on, get up.
Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get.  Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch.
Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. Gryffindor win!
Impedimenta!
Don't make me stupify you, Potter! Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker. That's you. There are three kinds of balls.  This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops.  The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops.  With me so far?
You better take this.  Careful now, it's comin' back.  Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater... Uh-oh.
Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you are the seeker, and the only thing I want you to worry about is this... the Golden Snitch. Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.
You catch it... before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.
Scared, Harry? That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.
Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.
I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We are gonna train earlier, harder, and longer. What- I don't believe it! Where do you think you're goin', Flint? I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
“I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker.” You've got a new Seeker. Who?
Watch yourself, Harry! Alright, listen up. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a
Well, that too. Professor McGonagall.
We can't cancel Quidditch. I'll take him from here. One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers?  Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone.
Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then.
Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid! Well done, dear.
Whooaaa! Ooh.
The third floor's clear too, sir. You idiot!
About time!  I've been looking all over for you two.  Names.
No exceptions, Potter. Aurors. For security.
Emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace.
You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely. Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!
The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.
The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game. The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!
Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor!
Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint. Another 10 points to Gryffindor!
He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!
Yeah! We won!! Another goal for Slytherin! They lead Gryffindor ninety to thirty!
Harry Potter has caught the Snitch! Gryffindor wins!
Blimey, Harry... ...and Slytherin is up forty to ten. Alica with the quaffle! Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.
A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.
Can you think of no one? Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck. Ha- ha- ha! Ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha! Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!
Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf.
Oh, oh yes, sir! Dobby understands! It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby wonders where to begin? S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? Oh, oh, ho. Oh, ho, ho… Oh, ho, ho. Ohh, ho, hoo…
Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.
No, I haven't. That was an awful thing to say. Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
Baaad Dobby!
Bad Dobby. Bad Dobby! Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.
The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here…ooh… But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter- to warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen.
Ooo… er… can't… say… argh... Don't make me talk, I— Errr…
Bad Dobby.
Let me go! Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?
Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Heh- Dobby hoped, if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir.
No! Ahh! Ooh… Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school!
Then, Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good.
Hello! Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby! Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
Indeed. Yes, sir.
At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see that--- Uhuh… Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands.
Uh-huh-huh… Dobby is used to death threats sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin…uh, huh, huh, huh! Aah, ahh… This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elves' enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Ah! Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here, now that history is to repeat itself.
Ah! I shouldn't have said that! Oh! Ah! Dah! Bad Dobby! Bad!
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe. Um-humm…
Ahh! Oow!
Master has given Dobby a sock! Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!
You shall not harm Harry Potter!
Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him? Anything, sir!
Mr. Harry Potter!
Dobby is cleaning, sir. Dobby...Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter. Dobby has heard him muttering in his sleep.
Dobby knows of the perfect place, Harry Potter! It is the Room of Requirement, sir. You can only use the room in times of great need. Whatever you need will be there for you, Harry Potter.
Dobby can show you now, if you wish, Harry Potter. Harry Potter!  So long it's been --
Dobby has also returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher!
Dobby was only trying to help! Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley, which Dobby thought was curious.  And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name, which Dobby thought was very curious.  And then Dobby saw that Kreacher was talking to the thief Mundungus Fletcher, which Dobby thought was very, very -- Master Weasley!  So good to see you again!
Aah!
Dobby has come to rescue Harry Potter, of course. Dobby will always be there for Harry Potter. Of course, sir. I'm an elf.
Sir? I like her very much. Meet me at the top of the stairs in 10 seconds.
Who gets his wand? Dobby never meant to kill. Dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure.
Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free elf. And Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends.
Harry Potter. Such a beautiful place... ...to be with friends. Dobby is happy to be with his friend... ...Harry Potter. Morning, Weasleys.
What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
Well now. Aah! And who are you? Good Lord! Are you really? Well, Ron's told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?
Did you really? How'd it go? Did you—
I mean…that was very wrong, indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck? Dumbledore must know you're here, Harry. Doesn't miss a trick, that man.
'Diaganilly.'
Children, it's mad in here! Let's go outside. Lucius.
We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.
10:58! Come on! Come on! Fred, George, Percy you first!
After you, dear.
Harry Potter. Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
Hermione.
Looking forward to a new term? Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me... from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you. But I think that you need to know the facts. You are in danger. Grave danger.
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
Do you know why? Thirteen years ago, when you stopped... Don't say his name.
When you stopped You-Know-Who... Black lost everything. But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant. And in his mind... you are the only thing that stands in the way... of You-Know-Who returning to power. And that is why... he has escaped from Azkaban. To find you.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear... you won't go looking for Black. Haven't the foggiest, keep up!
Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory everyone, he works with me at the ministry. And this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right?
That's it sir, just over there. Harry!
Let go kids!
Let! Go! I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?
Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup!
Home sweet home. Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, get out of the kitchen we're all hungry.
Feet off the table.
Come on up, take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for. Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've gotta get out of here. Now.
Get back to the portkey everybody, and stick together. Fred, George... Ginny is your responsibility.
Stop! That's my son. Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?
You can't possibly..
Barty, they're just kids. Harry, who?
If he keeps it up, he might end up in Azkaban. And that would give You- Know-Who a clear field to--
Well, come on, Harry. Time to go. Good, good, not very many Muggles.
Well, come on Harry, in we go.
I do love using the Fellytone! Now, let's see, what's the number again... Harry Potter, disciplinary hearing.
Keep close, Harry!
Ah, Perkins, good morn- Blast! Dumbledore thought they might try that.
Good lord, that was five minutes ago! Come on, Harry!
Yep, I've got no idea what they get up to in here, it's top secret. Come on, Harry!
Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely...
There you are, Harry, in you go...good luck... Harry, you've been let off! That's wonderful!
You were tried by the full court?
Ah...yes...I'm afraid we had a bit of a row. He, well, he sided with Fudge and the rest of us sided with Dumbledore, so Percy left. Dunno, Harry. Some things are just beyond comprehension.
Settle down, you three!
Sirius, we saw Fudge talking with Lucius Malfoy on Level Nine again. Tell Dumbledore, next time he comes in, would you? Well, I'd better be off. I've got a bewitched vomiting toilet to deal with.
Also, I'm covering for Tonks on guard duty later tonight, so I won't be back until late.
Come on, Harry! You'll have to forgive Remus.  It takes its toll -- his condition.
We're being followed, all of us. Molly doesn't leave the house most days.  It's not been easy.
Yes, but I thought it best if I replied in person.  If Dumbledore's traveling, it's news to the Ministry.  But perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.  As for Draco Malfoy -- I know a bit more. I sent an agent to Borgin & Burkes.  From what you describe, I think what you and Ron saw at the end of the summer -- the object that Draco seemed so interested in -- was a Vanishing Cabinet.
They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can imagine the appeal. Should the Death Eaters come calling, one needed only slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.  But they're tricky contraptions.  Require a tremendous amount of looking after.  Eventually they fell out of favor.
Nothing.  It's still there. Harry.  You know, I went through all this before -- the last time around.  Times like these -- dark times -- do funny things to people.  It can bring them together and it can tear them apart.  Things... speed up.  It's what happens when you don't know if today will be your last.
Harry, no!
Ginny, stay with your mother! Close the door.
These are for the Order.  So many are on the run now, it helps them to stay connected with the rest of us.  Know they're not alone...
Are we the last?  Where's George? Remus.  Where's my son?
It doesn't explain how they knew we were moving Harry tonight.
All together now! One.  Two.  Three!
How's it look on your end, boys?
I understand, Wakinda, but I can't be a party to that. Hello, Reg.  Isn't Mary in for questioning today?  Try to have faith.  If there's anything Molly and I can do for you --
Tell him to try an umbrella.
Is that a threat, Runcorn? What's going on here, Neville? Morning, everyone! Good morning, everyone!
Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Now, gather around, everyone. Today, we are going to repot Mandrakes. Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger.
Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor! Now, as our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won't kill you yet. But they could knock you out for several hours, which is why I have given each of you a pair of earmuffs for auditory protection. So, could you please put them on, right away? Quickly! Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly, you pull it sharply up out of the pot… Got it? And… now you dunk it down into the other pot and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
Uh, Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs.
Yes, well, just leave him there. Right! On we go! Plenty of pots to go around. Grasp your Mandrake, and pull it up! That doesn't mean we can't hold him up. Oh!
Oh, Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss, you can go. Out of my way. Out of my way! Should've been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat- but growing them back…
Oh, I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business. Well, what do you expect? Pumpkin juice?
Put him here. What happened?
Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva? Here, eat this. It'll help. It's all right. It's chocolate.
It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. It was searching the train for Sirius Black. If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver. Eat. You'll feel better.
Intriguing, isn't it? Would anyone like to venture a guess... as to what is inside? Very good, Mr. Thomas. Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
So terrifying, yes, yes, yes... Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. Let's practice it now. Without wands, please. After me. Riddikulus!
Very good. A little louder and very clear. Listen: Riddikulus! Very good. So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough. What really finishes a boggart is laughter. You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. Let me explain. Uh... Neville, would you join me, please? Come on, don't be shy. Come on. Come on. Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Sorry?
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all. And I believe you live with your grandmother. No... it won't. I want you to picture her clothes. Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
We don't need to hear. As long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when I open that wardrobe... here's what I want you to do. Excuse me. Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes. Can you do that? Yes. Wand at the ready. One, two, three. Think, Neville, think.
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay... to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line! Form a line! I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most... and turn it into something funny. Next! Ron! Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave! Wand at the ready, Ron, wand at the ready. Yes! You see? Very good, very good! Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next! Show us what you see. Keep your nerve. Steady.
And next! Step up, step up! Wonderful, wonderful! Here! Riddikulus! Right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today. Collect your books from the back. That's the end of the lesson. Thank you! Sorry! Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes? I would've thought it'd be obvious. I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort. I'm very impressed. That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself. This is very wise.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. Our pain becomes their power.
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by your scar, by your eyes. They're your mother, Lily's. Yes. Oh, yes. I knew her. Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. Not only was she a singularly gifted witch... she was also an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in others... even, and perhaps most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves. And your father, James, on the other hand... he... He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you. You're more like them than you know, Harry. In time, you'll come to see just how much. I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick. Is there no chance of fixing it?
Listen. Dementors are amongst the foulest creatures to walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory... until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. You are not weak, Harry. The dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past. Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Well I'd consider you a fool if you weren't. There was only one that night.
I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. But as the dementors seem to have developed a particular interest in you... perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays. For now, I need to rest.
Harry. There you are. You came. Are you sure about this, Harry? You know this is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level. Well, everything's prepared. Now, the spell I'm going to try to teach you is called the Patronus Charm. Did you ever hear of it? No? Well... A Patronus is a kind of positive force. For the wizard who conjures one... it works something like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him. But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory. Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this? Yes. Very well. Close your eyes. Concentrate. Explore your past. Do you have a memory? Allow it to fill you up. Lose yourself within it. Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
Very good. Shall we? Wand at the ready. Here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths. It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time. That would have been remarkable. Here, eat this. You'll feel better.
Oh, no, no, no. That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart. The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse. As a matter of interest, what were you thinking? Which memory did you choose?
That's not good enough. Not nearly good enough. Is it strong? Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?
Yes! Well done, Harry. Well done!
Yes. Sit down. Here. Eat this, it helps. It really helps. And just so you know, Harry... I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that... is saying something. Professor!
Harry, are you alright?
Oh, I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks as though it's merely a parchment designed to insult anyone... who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night. Come in. I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession... but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in. Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black... is a map to you?
Your father never set much store by the rules either. But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. Gambling their sacrifice by wandering around the castle unprotected... with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them! Now, I will not cover up for you again, Harry. Do you hear me?
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. And don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know. Oh, really? And who might that be?
That's not possible.
Expelliarmus! Well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged, aren't we? Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within. I know.
I understand.
How long have you known? Well, well, well, Hermione. You really are the brightest witch of your age, I've ever met.
Wait!
Very well. Kill him. But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why. No, Harry it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents... but it was somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
Severus don't be a fool.
Sirius be quiet. Severus, please.
He was at school with us. We thought he was our friend!
No, he didn't. I thought so too, until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the map! You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?
You should've realized, Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would! Together!
Harry, this man... Get away from her!
Immobulus!
Hello, Harry. I saw you coming. I've looked worse, believe me. No. No. I resigned, actually.
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition. This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want... well, someone like me teaching their children.
Dumbledore has already... risked enough on my behalf. Besides, people like me are... Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now. Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
Didn't make any difference? Harry it made all the difference in the world. You have uncovered the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. It made a great deal of difference. If I am proud of anything... it is of how much you have learned this year. Now, since I am no longer your teacher... I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. So now I'll say goodbye, Harry. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Until then... mischief managed.
Harry, douse the light. We're exposed here. We're your advanced guard, Harry. Dumbledore just sent us as soon as he heard about the attack. We're taking you to safety. We're just waiting for the all clear.
You didn't think Dumbledore'd let you wander around on your own, did you?
Harry, I don't believe you've met Nymphadora Tonks. Tonks, would you go get Harry's broom from the house?
Brooms.
On your broom, Harry. There's the second signal!
There's the other one, Alastor!
Harry, leave it to us! "Expecto Patronum!'
Get Harry to the safe house!
Stay here, Harry. Get in, quick, Harry. Don't touch anything.
We're doing our best, but it's proving to be...difficult.
Fudge likes being Minister of Magic. If it turns out that Voldemort came back under his watch, he'll be sacked. But Dumbledore is doing all he can.
I'm sorry, Harry, we can't say anything more.
Easy for you to say. Harry! HARRY!...he's gone...there's nothing you can do...
Harry, no!
Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission? Has it occurred to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so that he could find out what he's up to?
It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgement. He trusts Snape.  Therefore, I do.
You're blinded by hatred. You are!  People are disappearing, Harry.  Daily.  We can only put our trust in a handful of people. If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed.
There's someone out there.  I can smell him.  There's more than one --
Just remember, Fleur, once you're married:  Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now. The house!  Quickly!
What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts!
What Creature! We've been betrayed.  Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I had to make sure you weren't an imposter.
Snape. He'll be fine, Molly.  But that's Dark Magic.  The damage is done.
'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.' Mad-Eye reckoned You-Know-Who would expect the real Harry to be with the most skilled Auror.  He knew he'd be in the most danger.
Better.
We want you to be the godfather. Say yes.
Harry!  Go!  Go!
It's the quality of one's conviction that determines success, not the number of one's followers. Me.
Speaking of quality.
You shouldn't have. It's Teddy who needs you. And he will want it to be quick.
Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. Someday he'll understand... Harry Potter...
No. Only one will die tonight.
Are you going to kill me, Harry? Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you Remus? I found him.
It's him.
Let's kill him! Enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him!
I did my waiting! Twelve years of it! In Azkaban!
Peter Pettigrew! And he's in this room! Right now! Come out, come out, Peter! Come out, come out and play! Severus...
Brilliant, Snape. Once again you've put your keen penetrating mind to the task and as usual come to the wrong conclusion. Now, if you'll excuse us, Remus and I have some unfinished business... to attend to.
He can't help it. It's habit. Be quiet yourself Remus!
Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set!
The map never lies! Pettigrew's alive! And he's right there! Not you! Your rat!
Twelve years? Curiously long life for a common garden rat! He's missing a toe, isn't he?
Finger! That dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead! And then he transformed into a rat! How dare you speak to Harry! How dare you talk about James in front of him!
I would have died! I would have died, rather than betray my friends!
Sorry about the bite. I reckon that twinges a bit. I was going for the rat. Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog. In fact, more than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent. The tail I could live with. But the fleas, they're murder.
It's beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. It'll be nice to do it again as a free man. That was a noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it.
I don't know if you know, Harry... but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather. I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle... but if you ever wanted a different home...
It's just a thought. I can understand if you don't want to.
Remus, my old friend! Have you taken your potion tonight? You know the man you truly are, Remus! This heart is where you truly live! This heart here! This flesh is only flesh! Remus! Remus! Run! Run!
I'll be forever grateful for this... to both of you.
One day, perhaps. For some time, my life will be too unpredictable. And besides... you're meant to be here. And you know it. And for now, that will do. I expect you're tired of hearing this... but you look so like your father. Except your eyes. You have...
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little. But know this: The ones that love us never really leave us. And you can always find them... in here. You really are the brightest witch of your age.
Harry. I couldn't risk sending Edward. It was since the world cup and the ministry's been intercepting more and more owls and she's too easily recognised. We need to talk Harry. Face to face. Meet me in the Griffindore common room at one o clock this Saturday night and make sure you're alone. P.S.... The bird bites.
I don't have much time Harry so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the goblet of fire?
Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third man in the room? You didn't hear a name?
What was that?
Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry, the deatheaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe any more. I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater. And no one, no one stops being a deatheater. Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban.
I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry but whoever did it is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.
You don't have a choice. Keep your friends close Harry.
Shut up, you miserable old hag! Quiet!
Mother, yes. Dear old mum. Right.
Well, the Ministry is furious with you.
You'll have to go to an disciplinary meeting tomorrow. You surprise me, Harry. I figured the first thing you'd do is start asking about Voldemort.
He has a right to know, Molly.
I know what Dumbledore said, but he needs to know something. He's not a child, Molly.
He's not your son.
He's got me. He's like a son to me. What do you want to know, Harry?
He's hiding for the moment, because the Ministry is ignoring his return and he doesn't want that to change.
The last person You-Know-Who wanted to alert was Dumbledore. He's building up his army again, just like before.
You see, when the Ministry of Magic insists that Voldemort isn't back.
Well, they think I'm a mass- murderer, Lupin is a werewolf, Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry... You-Know-Who wants something. Something he didn't have last time. A weapon.
Yeah, absolutely.
Harry! You all right, Harry?
Harry, I've got something that might interest you.
This was the original Order of the Phoenix. Found it while we were cleaning. There's Mad-eye and Dumbledore, right next to Dedalus Diggle; Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was taken...;
then there's Frank and Alice Longbottom, tortured into insanity by Death Eaters; Lupin, of course..
I know, Harry, I know. I miss them too. It's not fair that I got to spend so much time with them and you didn't...
I know I'm not your father, Harry, but I'll always be there for you, if I can help it...
Kreacher, get out of here! Now! Kreacher. He's been alone with the house for years, he's gone a bit funny.
Put that away, James.
I'm bored. Wish it was full moon. Expelliarmus!
Locomotor mortis!
I would rather die! Get out of here, you two!
That will take you back out of the Department of Mysteries.
You're the important one, now, Harry. I have to help the Order. I'll always be here for you, Harry. Now go!
Hello, cousin!
Is that the best you've got, cousin? Quicker than falling asleep.
No. We're here, you see. Yes sir.
Alright.
Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...? Right. Hey listen, about the badges. I've asked them not to wear them.
Hey Potter.
How are you? Look I realise I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.
Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor?
It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg and mull things over in the hot water. Get down!
Get off me!
Harry! Harry! You know for a moment there I thought you were gonna let it get me.
Some game huh?
Go. Take it, you saved me! You ok?
Where are we?
It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey. What are you talking about?
What is it?
Who are you? What do you want? Harry take my body back will you? Take my body back to my father. Which of you conjured this?
Do not lie! You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!
Follow me. All of you, this way.
After much deliberation the ministry has concluded that for their own safety no student under the age of seventeen shall be allowed to put forth their name for the tri-wizard tournament. This decision is final.
The rules are absolute, the goblet of fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of tonight... a tri-wizards champion. Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if you will...
The welsh green. Mr Krum...
The chinese fireball. Oooooh. The swedish short-snout. Which leaves...
What's that boy?
The hungarian horntail. These represent very real dragons, each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple, collect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions? Get him another towel.
Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't spoken, after all your story is one I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. Tragic of course, to lose one's family. Never whole again are we? Still, life goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud today Potter.
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this counsel. Should your testimony prove consequential. Counsel may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain in the eyes of the ministry a convicted deatheater. Do you accept these terms? What do you wish to present?
Mr Rosier is dead.
If that is all the witness has to offer... Augustus Rookwood? Of the department of ministries.
Very well. Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime you will be returned to Azkaban.
Silence! Unless the witness possesses any name of genuine consequence this session is now concluded.
What's that?
Yes? The name! Give me the wretched name!
You are no son of mine. Two pumpkin pasties please.
Thank you.
Harry! Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a bit icey at the top.
Yes?
Sorry? I didn't catch that. Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's already asked me. And well I've said I'll go with him.
Harry I really am sorry.
And last year he got through the Triwizard Tournament! Yes, but Luna, it's lost. For centuries now. There's not a person alive today who's seen it.
It's a kind of crown. You know, like a tiara.
Ravenclaw's was rumored to have magical properties, to enhance the wisdom of the wearer. Professor Dumbledore, my horses have travelled a long way. They will need attending to.
But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink only single malt whiskey.
Well of course he is lying. Hagrid?
Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming, I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten me.
What is it you want to show me? When we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated. Ahh, c'est magnifique!
Can we get closer? That stupid roof.
Alastor Moody.
Ministry malcontent. And your new defence against the dark arts teacher. I'm here because Dumbledore asked me, end of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? When it comes to the dark arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many unforgivable curses there are? And they are so named?
Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now the ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say different! You need to know what you're up against, you need to be prepared, you need to find somewhere else to put your chewing gum other than the underside of your desk Mr Finnigan!
So, which curse shall we see first? Give us a curse.
Ahhh yes, your father would know all about that. Gave the ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why.
Hello. What a little beauty. Don't worry. Completely harmless.
But if she bites... she's lethal!
What are you laughing at? Talented isn't she? What shall I have her do next? Jump out the window? Drown herself?
Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only do did you-know-whose bidding under the influence of the imperious curse. But here's the rub, how do we sort out the liars? Another.. another.. Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up.
Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology. Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly nasty. The torture curse.
Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable curse Miss Granger.
The killing curse. Only one person is known to have survived it. And he's sitting in this room. Son. You alright?
Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something.
The hell he is. The goblet of fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object, only an exceptionally powerful conjurer could have hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year. It was once my job to think as dark wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember?
I can do that.
I'll teach you to cast when someone's back is turned. Teaching.
Technically it's a ferret.
Is that a threat! I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair boy! It doesn't end here!
He might've mentioned it.
come with me. That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an eye on my enemies. If I can see the whites of their eyes they're standing right behind me.
Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in ther. You wouldn't believe it if I did. Now... what are you going to do about your dragon?
Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, by your age he could take a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have a strategy, and you can bet that it'll play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come on Potter. What are your strengths? Better than fair the way I heard it.
You're allowed a wand.
Hate to break up this scholar session but Professor McGonagall would like to see you in her office. Not you Potter, just Weasly and Granger. Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now and could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!
Why don't you help Potter put his books back.
Put that in your mouth. Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter into one of the ministry's summer internships are we? Last boy who went into the department of ministries never came out!
And they say I'm mad.
Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest you to know that this conversation is no longer private. Yeah took a piece of me with him though didn't he.
Champions! Prepare yourselves.
Are you alright Potter? Does it hurt?
I'd better take a look at it.
What was it like? What was he like? The dark lord. What was it like to stand in his presence?
Were there others? In the graveyard, were there others?
Marvellous creatures dragons aren't they? Do you think that miserable oaf would have led you into the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would have told you to hold the egg under the water if I hadn't have told him first myself? Do you think Neville Longbottom the witless wonder could have provided you with gilliweed if I hadn't have given him the book that led you straight to it? Huh?? You won because I made it so Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the dark lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter.
Albus Dumbledore.
No. I'm sorry Albus.
Quiet, Dursley.
We're not talking about it here, it's too risky. Blast it.
I want 365 degree visibility on the return trip.
Right, let's go. Form up! Form up around Harry. Make it snappy! The advanced guard surrounds Harry.
We must be ready. This would be the perfect moment for Voldemort to strike Harry.
Mount your brooms, everyone. Here we go! The third signal, everyone. Let's
Stay in formation!
We need more height! Contacts to the south!
Come on, Potter! Keep moving!
Potter, getting yourself killed won't do a thing. Now move! We're not far, now!
Did you get rid of them?
Prepare for descent! Form up around Harry! Right, Harry, this way.
Here, read this.
Come on, inside. Hurry. Yeah, he's ruddy gorgeous.  What say we get undercover before someone murders him.
All right, all right!  You'll all have time for a cozy catch-up later!  We've got to get the hell out of here and soon!
Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you. You sneeze and the Ministry will know who wipes your nose.  Point is, we have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect: brooms, thestrals and the like. We'll go in pairs.  That way if anyone's out there waiting for us -- and I reckon there will be -- they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one.
I believe you're familiar with this particular brew.
Everyone here's of age, Potter, and they've all agreed to take the risk. Nip it, Mundungus!  All right, Granger, as discussed.
Straight in here, if you please.
For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning.  It tastes like goblin piss. Not yet you aren't.
Fancy this:  You're not you, so shut it and strip. You'll need to change too, Potter.
Blimey.  I almost forgot. Right then.  We'll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector. As for you, Harry...
The real Harry!  Where the devil are you, anyway?
You'll ride with Hagrid. Yeah, it's all very touching. Let's go.
Good luck, everyone.  On the count of three.  One... two --
Severus Snape? You saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save. My little sister!
Thank you! And you... . You helped!
Au revoir Ron. You are still beautiful to me, William.
Bill, look away -- I'm 'ideous.
He's too weak. This is the closest I could find to what you described, Hermione. Harry when the connection is broken you must get to the portkey. We can delay it for a moment to give you time but only a moment, do you understand?
This should cheer you up, Sirius. Look. Sirius grins.
All right, there, Snivellus? Impedimenta!
And now, the moment you've all been waiting for--
Another charity case, Lily? Nothing. It's more the fact that he exists, you see...
Levicorpus!
I will if you go out with me. Don't make me hex you, Lily.
Fine!
You're lucky Lily was here, Snivellus! Apologize to her! Now!
I would never call you that.
Lily! Hey Lily! You're nearly there, son.
Until the end. Let go. Sweetheart you're ready. Let go! Let go!
Haaaaaaaarry!...
Leave him alone, James Potter! What has he done to you?
Leave him alone, Potter!
I wouldn't go out with you if it were a choice between you and the giant squid! Now let him down. I said, leave him alone!
Then let him go!
Don't make him apologize. Honestly, you're as bad as he is! You make me sick, Potter.
Dear Sirius.  Thank you for Harry's birthday present.  You'd think he'd been born on a broom.
James says he's got the look of a Seeker, but then James would.  We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who dotes on Harry.  Wormy dropped by late in the day, but seemed down and didn't stay long.  James is frustrated being shut up here, but Dumbledore's still got his Invisibility Cloak, so he doesn't have much choice.  By the way, Bathilda tells the most amazing stories about our old Headmaster. I don't know how much to believe. Can it really be true that Dumbledore -- That's mean.
You've been so brave, sweetheart.
We never left, dear. Always... You boys go home now, or I'll be calling your parents!
Arabella Doreen Figg, resident of Little Whinging.
I was sitting on my porch when I saw the two Dementors gliding towards the two boys. Well, they were big and wore great, tattered cloaks.
I-I felt them. It was horrible...like I would never be happy again. Mad-eye, dear, you do realize that's disgusting?
Stop being so cheerful, Mad-eye.
We're there! Perhaps Harry's right, Remus.  To make an Unbreakable Vow, after all --
It was delicious, Molly.  Really.
No, we should go. The first night of the cycle is always the worst -- Sweetheart...
Remus!
My husband, the joker.  By the way, wait until you hear the news! Remus and I are -- Deserves that.  Brilliant, he was. Wouldn't be standing here without him.
He'll sleep 'til dawn and snore like his father. It's you who needs me tonight. I see them too, Harry.
Luna. Luna Lovegood.
There are other ways to fly. I mean, they can fly, and they're
Yes, there is. They're Thestrals. You can't see them unless you've seen someone die.
I'll show you. I do. It's coming from the Veil.
There are people in there!
They hit her with something too. Hello, Harry.
It's the last night and I need to pack.
Oh, people take my things and hide them. I don't think they like me much. Some of them call me "Loony" Lovegood.
Oh no. It all turns up in the end.
Sirius Black. Hermione said he was your Godfather. My mother. I was nine.
It's okay. It's not like I'll never see her again.
Don't tell me you didn't hear them. The voices beyond the Veil? They were just out of sight, that's all.
Of course. Anyway, my mum always said the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. If not always in the way we expect. Think I'll just go have some pudding.
Quibbler...?  Quibbler...? There's an article on Wrackspurts this month.  Quibbler...?
He's lovely.  They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know. Quibbler?
They're invisible creatures that float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. Quibbler?  Quibbler? Hello, Harry.
Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.
It's alright.  I enjoyed our walk. It was like being with a friend. That's nice.
Who are those people?
Would you like me to fix it? Personally I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way.  But it's up to you. No.  But I've done several toes and how different are they really?
Episkey.
Exceptionally ordinary. Hello, everyone.  You look dreadful, Ron.
Is that why you just put something in his cup.  Is it a tonic?
I've never been to this part of the castle.  At least not while awake.  I sleepwalk, you see. It's why I wear shoes to bed. Hello, Harry!
Oh, I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I?  I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.
Very well.  I was bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago. Come, Daddy.  Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.  He's just too nice to say so.
Ron? Harry?
You're bleeding, Harry. That's a curious thing to keep in your sock. Whenever you're ready, sir.
We should close his eyes. Don't you think? There. Now he could be sleeping.
It's beautiful here. Muggles think these keep evil away. But they're wrong...
The sky has lost a star.
My father used to say that when a child died. She looks up, smiles. I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That's why we don't need to talk about it.
Neither am I.
Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem. The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Hasn't anyone ever heard of it? It's quite famous.
Harry! Wait! I need to talk to
Harry -- Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem: 'There's not a person alive who's seen it.'
It's obvious, isn't it? We have to talk to someone who's dead.
He's very impressive, isn't he? If you're to find her, you'll find her down there.
No. I think it best if you two talk alone. She's very shy.
Thanks. I for one would like to know why Potter's qualified and the rest of us aren't. I don't know...if it were found...I mean, Umbridge wouldn't like what we're doing... Dumbledore, I've just seen them arrive at St. Mungos. Apperated there moments ago. He looks really bad. What are you doing in our forest?
You dare to insult us? Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one.
But then why don't people drink it all the time?
Give me a moment, girls. I know you're going to ask, Harry. But I don't know who cursed me. I've tried to remember.  Honestly. But I just... can't... Severus, please.  We're friends... Hello, Harry.  Bill Weasley.
True enough.  Owe it all to a werewolf by name of Greyback. Hope to repay the favor one day.
Mad-Eye's dead. Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated.
It was our Aunt's. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now as a safe house -- what's left of us, at least.
You're leaving, aren't you. And Griphook?
Listen, I don't know what you're up to, but I know goblins. If you've struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it. If you don't... he won't be forgiving. Mr. Potter!  By all means!
I certainly knew him the longest, if you don't count his brother Aberforth -- and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.
Yes, well, Dumbledore was always very private.  Even as a boy. The occasional owl.  Though it was strange...
It was the owls themselves.  They often arrived in distress.  It was clear they'd traveled great distances in some cases.
I'm afraid not.  Albus' messages mostly referenced our days together as schoolboys.  They were surprisingly intimate.  When he did speak of his current activities his words would turn elliptical.  Still, I sensed he was under great stress.  Why do you ask? Well, he treasured you, Mr. Potter, I can attest to that.  I can also tell you that when a person passes, it's only natural to rue the things left unsaid, to regret the question never asked. I knew Albus nigh on 100 years, but in many ways he will always remain a riddle even to me.
That woman is a vulture, Muriel, and you well know it.
I'm sorry you think so, Muriel.  I assure you I was writing from the heart. A monstrous betrayal.  I can only conclude the rumors are true and that she has become untethered.
Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter! In here, Potter.
You bloody fools! What were you thinking coming here? Do you have any idea how dangerous it is --
Where've you left him? Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.
Mundungus Fletcher, 'bout a year ago.
Sirius. Albus told me. He also told me that you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out I had it. But ask yourself where you'd be if I didn't. Right then. Reckon you're hungry. Let's get you fed, then think of the best way to get you out of here.
The Order is finished. You-Know- Who's won. Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.
Did he now? Nice job? Easy? It's not a job my brother's given you, it's a suicide mission. Do yourself a favor boy. Go home. Live a little longer.
Keep secrets? You tell me.
Did you now? And why is that? That's a boy's answer. A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who won't even tell him where to start. You're lying. Not just to me, which doesn't matter, but to yourself as well. That's what a fool does.
You don't strike me as a fool, Mr. Potter. So I'll ask you again. There must be a reason. Why do you trust anything my brother ever said to you? Why?
You know what to do... You'll see soon enough.
She'll always be beautiful.
My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter, in his journey to find power, including her. She was devoted to him -- he gave her everything, but time. Yes, sir.
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works. Earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead.
Peter Pettigrew. What are you talking about?
For me? But who sent it?
Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here? Hermione...
It was you!
And the doe.  That was you as well. Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you...
Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!
Not so brave now, are you Duddykins? Now tell your little friends to go away. I did think of Voldemort at first. But then I remembered that night on the train... and the dementor.
Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman... screaming.
I think it was my mother... the night she was murdered. They'll torture you.  Even Dudley. If they think you know where I'm going, they'll stop at noth--
Do you have any?  Magic?
Absolutely not.  Besides, I'm just a waste of space.  Isn't that right, Vernon? Where'd she get that from?
No one believes me, Hedwig. No one...
I'm alone... Go on.
I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.
The what? Well, then by all means come along, sir.
That would be counterproductive, sir.
No idea. I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir.  I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?
I never even knew he had a brother, sir.
Sir, I was wondering if you'd had much contact with him before he died. Hi, Hedwig.
Malfoy.
I found him! Malfoy?
No, Colin! Get out of the way! Let's take him to Hagrid's.
He'll know what to do. Devastatingly handsome.
Sir.  I'm sorry.  I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely --
I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir. And...it means me?
So it's not necessarily me, sir?
What if he chose wrong? You see Sirius talking to me there? He's asking me to come live with him.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'. It'll just be me and him. We could live in the country... someplace you can see the sky. I think he'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Let's go! What are you doing? Do you think he would've done it. Draco?
No.  He was lowering his wand.  In the end, it was Snape.  It was always Snape.  And I did nothing...
Yeah, strange.  Only... it's not. It's a fake. I won't let Sirius die!
Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there!
There isn't anyone else, Hermione! Everyone from the Order is gone! Ah! Oh… Okay.
Malfoy. He called Hermione, …um, well, I don't- I don't know exactly what it means.
What's a Mudblood? Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?
Why can't I drink it, sir?
Professor? I don't really know how to answer that, sir.
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?
You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle.  You were his teacher. A message...?
Traveling?  Where?
Positive.  Why? Thank you!
Excuse me, who are you?
Sorry, no. Impedimenta!
Fight!  Fight back, you coward!
Sectumsempra! No, there isn't!
How?
That's all we'll need. But I'm telling you.  I saw it --
What if there are two?  Vanishing cabinets.
I don't know... Aah!
Sorry. Lost- lost control of the trolley. Why can't we get through?
The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock. We've missed it! Yes, Aunt Petunia.
Yes, Uncle Vernon.
He's asleep! Wait a minute.
No, Ron! No!
He's going to sacrifice himself! What does she see in him?
You called him a slick git not five hours ago.
I suppose. I've told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven't noticed, we've found a Horcrux!
Yeah, he would.  D'you think I haven't noticed the two of you whispering behind my back?  D'you think I haven't guessed what you were thinking?
You think I don't listen!  You think I don't know what it's like -- But who...?
A little.
What happened? You sent the Dementors?
Hermione, no!
I would rather die! Wait a minute.  One of the teachers?
Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?
Norbert? When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will always fail you.
Together.
I told you: it's useless to you. You've--!
You can't!
If you quit, we'll be out four players! We need to get out of here. Luna, can you help Ginny?
Let my friends go and I will.
Stop, Neville! What is it, Dobby.
Don't worry about it, Dobby. But I don't think you can help me.
Actually, there is something you can do, Dobby. Come on. This way. This way, now. Now what?
How?
And now we wait. I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now!
Get back to the cup!
Cedric! I'm a bit preoccupied right now, Luna.
We'll talk later, Luna.
Later. I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things.
I just Apparated, didn't I?
Can't imagine why... Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough… Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! It's alright, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. So what happens?  If you break an Unbreakable Vow?
Draco's plotting something, I know it, something to do with Voldemort.  He's been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help.
I know it sounds mad -- Dudely.  Vernon Dudley.
The list is wrong.  I told you who I am --
What did you put on me? Yes?
Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.
Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard. But listen, if it means so much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account. I've never really thought about it.  But I suppose, yeah.  Very nice.
I think I'll be going to sleep now.
What? The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn't steal it.
And she never suspected?
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well? Sir?
Who took her, sir?
They've kidnapped Luna because he supported me.  He was just desperate. They're my letters! Let go of me!
Make a wish, Harry.
I-I am. Hagrid!  We've got to help the others!
What was that?
Hagrid... HAGRID...! Professor?
Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?
It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son. Here.  Let me do that.
Miss Bagshot?  Who is this man?
His name.  Can you tell me his name? He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes?
Ginny-
Ginny… So I get to spend the summer with the Dursleys while you two are here.
You've still been here!
What's been going on? My word.
Sir, I thought one couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts.
It's there, isn't it? What happened to me?
And did either of you two... you know... pass out?
But someone was screaming. A woman. London.
Yes, Professor.
Dobby! What are you doing here? Dobby. Dobby. No, just-- Hold on. Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay? We'll fix you. Hermione will have something. In your bag. Hermione? Hermione? What is it? Help me.
I want to bury him. Properly. Without magic.
I need to talk to the goblin. Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
I must be out of my mind.
Myrtle! All right. Let's go.
Uh…thanks Myrtle.
Aaah! Shut up! Shut up!
No! She deserved what she got! Keep away from me.
Yeah? Try me. Well it sets my teeth on edge. What's he expecting to hear?  Good news?
And what gets you through the day?
How long before he can travel? Who says I was talking to anyone.
Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time.
Neville! You're doing it again! Mum?  Dad?
Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this!  Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!
There's something you've got to see. Now, come on! Oh yeah.
Do you know why I survived?  The night I got this.
Because of her.  Because she sacrificed herself.  Because she refused to step aside.  Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort. Um... I don't know?
It's a long story.
It's a long story. It looks like King's Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And without the trains.
Sir, why didn't you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows?
Sir -- Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!
Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul.
He does. Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.
Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin.
Wow. Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway.
This way.
It's a snakeskin. Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.
It's some kind of cloak.
My body's gone! I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor Umbridge.
That's brilliant, Dobby!
Better not, Dobby. School is pretty intense right now. We'll do it ina few months, before the holidays. Then what? The goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his eyes
She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there. She kept asking you what else we'd taken. I'd bet anything there's a Horcrux there. If we find it, we can kill it. And if we kill it, we're one step closer to killing him.
I'm still working on that part. Ughh!
Ron!
We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe. We got lost.
I don't know, sir.
I don't know, sir. Because I asked it to.
Godric Gryffindor.
Dobby! So this is your master! The family you serve is the Malfoys You're doomed.
Oh- Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.
Stop! Stop! Hold still! When'd you get here?
Oh come on...
But we're talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be safer? And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!
He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone. Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please be quiet! Are you all right?
Your family?
What terrible things? Who's plotting them? Excuse me?
You'll forgive me, Minister.  But it's a little hard to tell the difference these days.
You mean -- But that's brilliant -- I... don't know what to say. Which would be, sir?
Sir, my mother's Patronus. It was a doe, wasn't it? Just like Professor Snape's. Curious, don't you think?
Professor. Rictusempra!
Sya- hassa- she. Sya- hasi- heth. Sya- hasi- heth.
I'm a what? Hey, Neville.
Uh...same to you, Luna.
That's the first time you've said his name. I've got something to tell you. Something important.
But not right now. I'm not ready.
Do you need any help looking? 'Can you tell me?'
Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here? Are you Tom Riddle?
Dumbledore? We were better without you, happier without you.
Ron.  It lies!  Stab it!  STAB IT!
Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a son... Yes.
We got away.
Are you alright? Hermione.  His arm --
What happened?  I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place.
Don't be stupid. We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's in the school. But we'll need your help getting in.
If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him, and then we can end this war once and for all. We need to get into Hogwarts tonight. Hermione! She doesn't know!
It’s going into the Girl's Bathroom!
Hermione, move! Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
I'm not ready for this Sirius.
Someone's coming! Come on! Pull!
We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.
Wish you were here Hermione. We need you… now, more than ever. Split up!
No, it''ll just follow us!
Here! Take one! But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
It's his… stomachache. Calm down.
Hair! No, 'course not.  How are you, Luna?
Nice to meet you, sir.
Sir?  May I sit down? Shh!
Hagrid!
We know about the Philosopher's Stone! Don't touch him.
Have it your way.
He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there. Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them...
I think I'd take the dragon right now.
But then again he can take himself. Sorry.
And kill me.
Mr. Weasley... why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me? Fluffy?
Queen to E5.
That's wizard's chess.  I see you've packed. You're sure it's hers?
You heard Ollivander. It's Harry's now.
How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything. To the Department of Mysteries?
Yeah. They can't just waltz into the Ministry of Magic!
Shut up, Malfoy! Attractive?
Skin?  You're saying Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?
Hermione's got nice skin. Wouldn't you say?  As skin goes, I mean. Ahh- hhh…
Can we panic now?
Know any spells? What if he were still on his...
What if he's still on his mission from Dumbledore?
You reckon she's here to spy on us? What?!
They're headed to the Dark Forest! Why spiders! Why couldn't it be “follow the butterflies?”
Harry, I don't like this… Harry, I don't like this at all! Wicked trainers.
Piece of advice.  Let's not rehash old times.  Got it... mate?
No.  He's worried he should have got more money for it. Get to know him?
Um... You've got a little...
Bit worried about her.  Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in the pub?  Her and me snogging.  Ha.  As if... Barking.  Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us? What?
O-kay.
Aw, bloody hell... What the bloody hell was that all about?
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.
Not good, brilliant. What do you mean, people?
Harry, have you seen this?
Er...it's got your name on it. Where's Hermione when you need her?
Whoah!
Glad we're out of there! Ah- Aaaah! Not to mention you dueled with You- Know-Who all alone and he still couldn't kill you!
She can't!
Or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her. You there! D-5!  Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!
Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.
You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King. You'll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs!
It's disgusting.
Hear what? Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.
On second thought, just the drewbals.
Just the drewbals, thanks. Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though.
You know bloody well what.
Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend. We wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get intercepted. There is an awkward silence.
He thought you would be safest there.
We've only seen him twice, and not for very long. He's really busy. Drive!
Do you think it'd be all right if we had some of this?
It's not much, but it's home. Right. So let's do it.  Who gets who?
The world's mental.  Come on, drink up.  We've got a Horcrux to find.
In case you're interested, I'm Reg Cattermole, Magical Maintenance Department. I haven't lost anything! Your cat killed him!
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone.
Your cat killed him! What are what?
And what about those of us who can't see them? Luna comes over to them.
Never again... Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know.
Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen.
How did you do it? Hiyya, Harry.
Good as new, mate.
Yeah ? Scabbers, you bit me!
Harry, Hermione, run! It's the Grim! Harry!
Help! That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.
It's bad. They get scary when they get older.
Well... yeah... a bit
Merci. Fine.
I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire.
Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back. Brilliant.
I still think it was brilliant.
Who do you think that is? Well... there is... something. But no.  It can't be.  Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn't I?
So.  Did you and Ginny do it?
You know.  Hide the book. But, it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'll just go right through you.
We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.
That'll be a cheerful visit! “Hello, Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?” A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off!
You better go.
I'm fine. Go. What about my sister?!
You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!
Is there anything you can do? Good luck, mate.
What are those?
C'mon.  Mum's got dinner ready. My name.  Just my name.  Like a whisper.
So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared.  And I knew.
Just knew.  On account of Hermione's voice.  And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here. Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...
Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.
Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too! All right? You?
Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on. Get your trunk!…
You'd better stand back. Let's go! Mental that one, I'm telling you.
There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin.
Harry, what is it? When did she get here?
Riddikulus!
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop. We never did got a chance to go to the Shrieking Shack though. You heard it's the most... Lav, c'mon. Of course I'll wear it.
It's beautiful, isn't it?  The moon.
It was on your bed.  The box. Thought I'd try one... Dean?  He's brilliant.
Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?  Something snaps.  You've got to hate him.  You know, on principle.
So what is it?  He sees in her? That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
I'll be right back.  Want to play chess?
We go and visit Hagrid? Let's open it.
Thats not just any broomstick, Harry.  It's a Nimbus 2000!
Yay! But I'm your brother!
C'mon. Let's go.
Hi. This is Dolohov.  I recognize him from the wanted posters.
So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?
Suppose it's him that did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then? Wait a minute...he's.... Sleeping.
Uh. It's got horrible breath!
What?! Scar...?
Wicked.
No, thanks, I'm all set. I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.
She could never annoy me.  I think... I think I love her.
Do you think she knows I exist? No.  Can you introduce me?
How do I look?
Where's Romilda? Kill?
I don't like spiders… What's that?
Are you mad? Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.
I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.
Ahh! Right.  Antlers.
No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there --
Anything? Bloody hell.
What are those??
Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar. He was a catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days.
Yes...
Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse. Well, I've got one.  Here.  It's Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.  I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back.
Don't tell Hermione, but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.  This one was definitely part Troll.  The smell off him...
Wo. Ugh!
Go on.
What's this? Oh, sure, that's why.
Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all...
Come on, lets go back downstairs! Alohomora?
Probably thinks this door's locked.
What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school. Well Hermione, you're a girl.
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad.
Bloody hell. Thank you Nigel.
Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress?? Scabbers has been in my family for...
So what?
What are you trying to do to him? Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing? Luna?
Keep off the dirigible plums.
Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help Harry? What?
'Fraid he's right. One problem: Snape's Headmaster now. We can't just walk in the front door.
Maybe it's because of the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying. You're bloody well welcome!
Where will he take her?
Look inside him, Harry. Krum!!!
There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind. He's more than an athlete, he's an artist.
Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you. Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?
Bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny. Long story.  Nice meeting you.
Piss off.
No, don't!  Don't say it! So painful. They might chop it.
It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off.
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea. I feel really... bad.
These girls are gonna kill me, Harry.
Er... My... Nee... Er!  My!  Nee! I don't remember this being on the Marauder's Map.
Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what's a bloody diadem?
Six months she hasn't seen me and it's like I'm Frankie First Year. I mean, I'm only her brother. You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.
It's Levioooosa, not Leviosaaaar.  She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!
Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes.  What? But you heard McGonagall! We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!
Hagrid's right! With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day! I know what it means!
We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one? What?
Wingardium Leviosa!  Cool.
Well, what it is... Never mind. I'm good.  That is you in there, isn't it?
Hey. Easy.
What do you mean? Oh, don't try one of them. Oh, no. Look at him. His face.
Where did you come from?
Sure. So...no giants are coming?
Lockhart didn't teach as much as prune himself.
Get McGonagall! Go! Me too. Hermione: I didn't expect it to be like this.
You do it.
Yes, you can. What?
We've got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe.
What was that about? I'm trying!
Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him! I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?
What's that? Liar!
He saved your life.
Well done, Malfoy! Ahh! Ahhhh! Ahh!
Aaaahhhh!
Ahh! But what does it mean?
I think Hermione's right.  I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What say we vote on it?  Those in favor...
Sorry, Harry.  Looks like it's Hermione and me this time. Bloody hell. We/'ll never find him on this.
Brilliant.
Let's go. Brilliant. Loads of old stuff... like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
Along with the dung beetle.
I haven't shown anyone. Nothing.
Maybe a bit more practice, eh?
All right. Can we go back now?
Harry.
Harry! That's a bit scary.
Always good value. I'll miss her.
What d'you think? Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?
No.
No.  I got an owl from Dad this morning.  The one at Borgin & Burke's?  It's still there. Ginny these must be for you.
What are you on about?
Dress robes? for what? Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.
I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.
Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out. Hermione!!
Now what are we gonna do?!
Ahh! Harry! This is no graveyard.  It's a chessboard.
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight.
Well, white moves first, and then...we play. Mary.  Go home.  Get the kids. I'll... I'll meet you there.  We have to get out the country, understand?
Mary!  Do as I say!
I'm sorry.  It's just -- Twice.
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here. Never done that before, have we?
I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo.
Hey ya -- Well... thanks. Good!  Tell him from me he's a git!
Hey!  I think you two better come down here.
The two clinging to the tree are Death Eaters for sure.  Dunno 'bout the bloke on the bench. Can't see us, of course.  But we'll have to be careful coming and going.  C'mon.  There's something else you need to see. Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
Of course. You heard him! 'You'll be next Mudbloods,'
Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling. Sure. Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before... and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
What's going on?
There's something moving out there. I think... someone's coming aboard. You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.
So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.
Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake. I know something that could cheer you up.
Hagrid's back!
That's got to be what Surgis Podmore was doing in the Ministry when he was arrested. Actually, I was going to ask you.
Really.  But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --
Don't drink that, Ron! Oh, do you mind me trying? The Grim, possibly.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach! Ow! You stood on my foot!
Alohomora.
The harp. It stopped playing. The wandmaker?
Viktor got his wand from Gregorovitch.  Most Durmstrang students did at one time.  What's he got to do with You-Know-Who?
Don't -- It... comforts him. Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most. That's what makes them so...
It's not funny, Ron.
But sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks. We're not meant to start that for weeks. That was different.  It was tryouts.  This was an actual match --
You didn't put it in? Ron only thought you did?
Charms spell.  Just practicing. You destroyed it?
Don't think this changes anything.
See me doing what things? Yes.  Why?
Why didn't I think of that?
Um... it's a surprise.  Besides, it's you we need to worry about. And you can't pick just anyone. See that girl over there.  That's Romilda Vane.  Rumor has it she's trying to slip you a love potion. Shaftesbury Avenue.  I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad.  Just popped into my head.  I don't know why...
This way!
We need to change. And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
At least someone's enjoying himself. There he is.
He vanished. Just now. I saw it. Ron glances at MAP -- then:
That's right. I did. Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now.
I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?
I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time. There's nothing there, Harry.
Well, let's try a few.
There's no one here, Harry. This isn't the right room. Why not?
The binding is fragile?
The who? This is horrible.
Harry, listen to me. No one's coming.
You're dying... both of you. Harry! It's dangerous, Harry.  But I have to admit, recently even I've been thinking we might have to go.  I think it's possible something else is hidden there. The sword.  If Dumbledore didn't want it falling into the Ministry's hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself?
Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?
Don't ever let me give you a haircut again. He's vile.
No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.
I'd like to know just whose book that was.  Let's take a look, shall we? I told you.  Ron's not strong enough to Apparate.
No one can conjure food out of thin air.  Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law.  The other four are --
Good plan. Expelliarmus!
Stop lying!
You've still got it. Lumos !
Look.
No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real. Just now. You?
Wake up. Wake up Ronald!
Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready. Boys.
Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.
They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes. I thought I just saw... Never mind.
Okay, go, Harry. Go!
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on. Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?
Harry! Hagrid!
Oh, it's so good to see you! Rubbish.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
Did not. Harry! I can see you! In here!
Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?
That's Ariana, isn't it? Your sister. She's beautiful. Ron's okay with it, you know.  You and Ginny.  But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.
We reckoned -- Ron and me.
I've always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you're really thick. Ron's right.  Cappuccino, please.
Too dangerous.  If Voldemort's taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.
I've had the essentials packed for days.  Just in case. Yes!
I don't want you to say anything you wouldn't say if we weren't about to be killed by a giant snake! It'll just ruin it!
What's the matter with her? Maybe we can --
He loved you, Harry.  I know he loved you.
Who could look at you beside Harry Potter?  What are you, compared with the Chosen One...? Ok, good.
I think we should put our names down, so we know who was here.
Honestly, Ernie, do you think I'd just leave it lying around? Besides, its enchanted. Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.
Just relax!
Do what I say. Trust me. We?
Don't forget to give Professor Longbottom our best. Yes.
I'm fine.  But you've been sick. Rest... Rest a bit more...
The Forest of Dean.  I came here once with my mum and dad, years ago.  It's just how I remember it. The trees.  The river.  It's like nothing's changed.  Not true, of course.  Everything's changed.  If I brought my parents here, they wouldn't recognize any of it.  Not the trees.  Not the river.  Not... me. Try Finite Incantatem.  Of course if something's gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm --
This is you.
I don't like him being on his own down there. Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice. With each full moon, when he transforms, he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path. Furthermore, the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!
How are you feeling? Mr. Lovegood.  Thank you, sir --
No matter, sir.  We really ought to be go--
Ron!  Harry!  Take my hand! Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
Come on. Everywhere else is full. No! Please, stop!
We have to tell her, Harry...
We were trying to find Professor Dumbledore. We had to tell him... We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.
Is that...a dragon? It's obvious, isn't it?
The Cloak.
Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered. But I hate that thing -- that's the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel...
It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --
It's perfect. Thank you, Fleur. Some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, like Lucious Malfoy.
The Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore started it last time to fight You-Know-Who. He only reorganized it after last term.
They'll have to let you off, Harry... You were defending Tea?
I hate it.  It's like he's here with us.
Incendio! No! I trusted you! And all this time, you've been his friend. He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes.
Since Professor Snape set the essay.
You attacked a teacher! Now what do we do?
Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this... Petrificus Totalus.
Sorry. Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?
What's got your wand in a knot?
The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends. Harry. Harry, are you all right?
No one was screaming, Harry.
Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry. Harry, you can't just disappear. We thought --
It's from your Mum.  To Sirius. Bathilda Bagshot...?
Did she now? Voice? What voice?
Harry, wait! Not so fast!
'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened… enemies the heir… beware.' It's written in blood. He lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.
Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy. Three sir.
Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will...
Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it! It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.
You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream.
Alastor Moody? The aura. Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
I told you.  I don't know what I saw.
Where's Harry? 'I open at the close?'
I don't know.  But look, I've found something as well...
I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don't think it is. It isn't a rune and it's not in Spellman's Syllabary either.  And it's been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn't part of the book. She's hurt!
Harry, you'd better take her to Professor Grubby-Plank. She'll know what to do.
Harry, are you all right? Hope you don't mean yourself!
Harry!
But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you? Yeah but I heard Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this.
Dufftown? That's not far from here.
No one knows. Here we come.
That's great.
Harry! Run! It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.
Oh well spotted.
I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes. The what?
Yes.
It's in here. We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Ron. You're okay. The dog. Where is it?
If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too! Please! please!
Harry, are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?
Positive. Harry turns to the two wands on the table -- the ones he showed Ollivander -- and extends the longest to Hermione. Brilliant.
Did you see where it went? The diadem!
Do we climb! Completely, utterly, without question.
Mafalda Hopkirk, assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office.
You're somebody.  Be careful. How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...
Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.
Your wand harry! Your wand! Muggles.  In their rightful place.
You appear to be quite popular.
I didn't. Oh, Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta. Ron fancies her.
Harry!
So rude. Excuse me, I have to go vomit.
Dead. Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol' Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret?  Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One.
You're going to have to persuade him somehow.  And now, I'm afraid, you've made it a lot harder. That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when he said…
It's a bit strange, isn't it?
You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just… strange. What d'you mean -- wearing it?
Why would someone have drawn it in a children's book?
And it's exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you. No.
Everything's going to change now isn't it?
Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you. That's... not possible.  No one can leave the castle these days. The Map is wrong.
I might ask you the same.
I happen to be his... friend. It's hot! All eyes turn to the bowl, WOBBLING MADLY on the floor, when... it SPLITS APART and begins to MULTIPLY.
Ron, your foot!
How're we going to reach it? Keep trying. Come on. Quickly. Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay? Come on. Come on, Buckbeak. Come and get the nice dead ferret. Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
Come on, Buckbeak. Come on. It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!
Leave it to me.
Lacarnum Inflamarae. Silenco! Stupify!
Harry!
Come on, let's go in to the feast. Harry!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where do you suppose this goes? Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius. Any minute the dementors are going to perform the Kiss.
No. It's worse. Much worse. They're going to suck out his soul. Headmaster, you've got to stop them. They've got the wrong man.
The point is, we know the truth. Please believe us. Well, unless one of you fancies wearing a skirt...
Remember what we said.  Keep your eyes down.  Don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.  Act as normal as possible.  Just do what you see everyone else doing. We do that -- and with a bit of luck -- we get ourselves inside. And then...
Correct. What did you do to your glasses? Oculus reparo.
Ok! Bye!
Come on! Everyone's been so worried. Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
What's this all about?
Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there! She's not alone.  Even my parents -- and they're Muggles -- know something bad is happening.
There's been a lot of chatter lately.  That he's gotten... old.
These are adorable. We'll also need to keep everyone away from her office.
We'll probably only manage five minutes or so.
Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry. Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly.  What an idiot.
You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.
The staircases change, remember? We need to talk.
I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.
See this?  It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.  It's the mark again. What're you saying?
Stop it!
Penelope Clearwater.  Half-blood. Saving your life!
Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!
That was so scary. Harry.  You already destroyed one Horcrux, right?  Tom Riddle's diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets.
Don't you see!  In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor.
Its blade is impregnated with basilisk venom. I've got something. But it's mad.
Relashio!
It doesn't realize it's free! I didn't!  Not like that!  Harry -- I didn't!
Stop!  Stop!
Me? Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don't believe it was a long conversation --
Does, doesn't she?  And you say you don't remember a thing from that night?  Not one thing?
Right.  Boggled... It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn't a student.
Thanks, Sir Nicholas!
It's good to be back! Congratulations! I can't believe you solved it! Just forget it.
What a load of rubbish.
Me? I've been here all this time. Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.
But sir, the second task is only hours away and...
Harry! Stupify!
Colloportus!
Harry, they went the wrong way! Follow me!
I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
Of course! Here it is!  "Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!" Just go. You're wasting time!
Go away!
Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat's hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes. Look at my face. The boy survives.
He has her eyes.
The Dark Lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger when he does. It's fine. Now listen to me, Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do everything Professor Snape tells you.
Close your mind! You will understand, in time. Fudge is stirring.
Lay back down. They must not think we have had time to talk. Don't... don't make me...
Nooooooo!!!
Make it stop... Please... make it stop... Oh, no, Harry.  Your blood is much more precious than mine.
Careful.  The water.
It's there.  The only question is how do we get to it? Harry get away from there!
Are you alright Alastor?
Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus. Kill me!  It's the only way!
Water. Water...
Aguamenti. Water!
Go...
We have to... go. Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we…?
I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence.
Well, what exactly is it that you want with me? This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.  It's also a lie. This memory has been tampered with.  In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn.
I suspect he is ashamed of it.
Why indeed. Yes.
Remember... the water.
Oh yes. Did what? Good night.
Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen...
So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam Maxime. Trust me.
Good evening, Draco.  What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening?  Or is it Summer?
I often talk aloud to myself.  I find it extraordinarily useful. That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. Haven't been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco? Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time?  No.  Had I...
Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.  Can you guess which teacher that might be?
No.  I did not.  You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... I'd rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry.  But I promise. In time you will know everything. You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush?
And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?
Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like you, Severus. We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution… to all.
There's been another attack.
It means…that our students are in great danger. Once there was a young man who, like you, sat in this very Hall. Walked this castle's corridors. Slept beneath its roof.  He seemed, to all the world, a student like any other.  His name? Tom Riddle. The Hall goes utterly silent.
Today, of course, the world knows him by another name.  Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact.  Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle.  But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you.
Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed.  Pip pip! Ah yes.  Introductions.  Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.  Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. Apparently there's some thought he may be the Chosen One.
So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't perhaps expecting someone else, were you?
Take matters into their own hands? I daresay I can. And if you actually do attack me with that wand, Harry, I'm afraid to say you will regret it.
It is my fault Sirius died tonight.
Harry, I owe you this explanation, to show you the failings of an old man. I think I know a lost cause when I see one.  Regrettable.  I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace.  You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind.
Indeed they are.
You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values.  Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry.  You would be his crowning jewel.  That is why he is returning to Hogwarts.  And it is crucial he return... Your word, Harry.
Take my arm.
Being me has its privileges. Ingenious.  Let me guess.  It has a sister.  A twin.
A passage, yes.  Very good. I once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices.  Let me help you, Draco.
Say that again, Draco.  But aloud this time. I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk.  No light could resist it...
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?  The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I'm afraid now is not the time to tell it.  Take my arm.
Indeed.  And quite successfully I might add.  Most people vomit their first time. Good evening, Bellatrix.  I think introductions are in order.
Severus...
Severus... please. Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and, above all, those who live without love.
Actually, if I think about it... it doesn't seem curious at all.
Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should that mean that it is not real? Should I tell you to run, you will run.
And should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself...
You will do so. Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! Now, I'd like to say a few words... before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin... who's kindly consented to fill the post... of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Good luck, Professor.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher... has decided to retire... in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce... that his place will be taken by none other... than our own Rubeus Hagrid. Finally, on a more disquieting note... at the request of the Ministry of Magic... Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban... until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. Now whilst I've been assured... that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... a word of caution. Dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish... between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you... to give them no reason to harm you. It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. But you know, happiness can be found... even in the darkest of times... if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Make way. Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks.
For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch.
My dear old friend, thanks for coming. Raise the alarm. We must make sure Arthur is found by the right people.
Many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in other institutions, allowing them to move between them.
Fawkes, we will need a warning. King's Cross! Is that right? Well, this is, as they say, your party.
You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn't trust
I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor. But I crave your pardon, Harry. It's clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you are the better man. This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him.  I'd like you to see it.  If you would...
I am not family.  But his name has been known to me since birth.
Perhaps you could give me an example. Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.
There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all.
Good luck...Harry Potter. You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry.
There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest strength...
What can't I know? No, Harry.  I do not pray.  I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate.
Hide yourself below.  And do not speak or show yourself without my permission.  No matter what.
Do as I say, Harry. You can do things, can't you, Tom? Things the other children can't.
Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom.
I'm like you, Tom.  Different. I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his weakness. There is an ancient magic which Voldemort has always underestimated.
This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia.
Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt's house your home, you are protected. I beg your pardon?
Oh, yes.
Voldemort. I will return here later tonight, after I have seen to Harry. It should not take long. He taps the Golden centaur head.
Portus.
The Second War has begun, Minister. Again, I cannot have you manhandling my students, Professor Umbridge.
Well, Minister. You've caught me.
Quite correct, Cornelius. I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you?
Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are.
Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate. Why did you want these things, Tom?
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts.  At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? I'll be going now, Tom.  Leave your window open tonight.  An owl will bring you a message.  Read it carefully.
It is unusual.  But not unheard of. My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If you insist.
Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging.
Perhaps. oOh. Severus. Forgive me, Harry, I...
... I was merely curious. In any event, I'm sure you're wondering why I've summoned you here tonight.  The answer lies here.
What you see before you are memories.  In this case pertaining to one individual:  Voldemort.  Or as he was known then... Tom Riddle. A trait people never fail to undervalue.  I'm afraid.
The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry.  I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise.  But there is a condition:  You must obey any command I give you -- without question.
Understand what I'm saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide. I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry.
Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared.
No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone. They can be anything.  The most commonplace of objects.  A ring, for example.  Or a book...
It's a Horcrux, yes.  Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley's life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this I knew.  This was a different kind of magic.  Very dark.  Very powerful.  But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful...
Belonged to Voldemort's mother. It was difficult to find and... She's not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified.
But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say…
Innocent until proven guilty, Severus. The irony of course, Severus, is that -- in the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing...
You cannot help.
Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk. It's such a very long name...
Here we are, minister. Follow me. Now, look there.
Look beyond the rocks. My fault.  It's all my fault...
Too much... I can't... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY!
Your word, Harry!  Your word! Witness for the Defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.
Only if the Dementors are still taking their orders from only the Ministry these days. I believe you know my views on this, Cornelius.
Excellent. Perhaps not.
If you would, Harry...
Only recreationally.  You see, I believe one creates one's own luck. Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School.
And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry… first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um… second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?
I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?
Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?
You're absolutely sure? Dear lady, who did this to you?
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
Ah, thank you. There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him.
But this is touching, Severus. Don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy?
Lily. After all this time? Harry.  You need a shave, my friend.
At times I forget how much you've grown.  At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.  I am an old man.
Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind. Minerva, the rest of the Weasleys will need to be awoken.
Phineas.
Phineas, I need you to visit your other portrait. Tell Sirius what happened and that we are coming to stay for a while. I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this. How could you? You've been with us all the time.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister. Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy. Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. Thank you.
Well? Well, this makes matters much more straightforward.
Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of Lord Voldemort's plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?
You must agree. How do you do, Tom.
As you wish.
No.  I am a Professor. In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way.
On the count of three... ONE...
Harry! Harry! Scabbers?
I do, Miss Granger. But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true... is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. Mysterious thing, time. Powerful... and when meddled with, dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime. If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. If you succeed tonight... more than one innocent life may be spared. Three turns should do it, I think. Oh, and by the way. When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. Good luck.
Minister, I really think I should sign as well. And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff.
Igor.
Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them. This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.  You have no choice. You must not fail.
Quick thinking on your part, Harry.  Using a Bezoar.  You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?
Why indeed. …They are not.
I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.
Argus! Argus, I… Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except… you three. You are not an assassin, Draco.
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me?  Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.  Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I'm curious.  When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper?
Then I shall make it easy for you. How is he?  Horace?
This is beyond anything I imagined.  In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific.  I know now... you will see worse.
Oh he succeeded.  And not just once.  Think, Harry.  He's just told us. Back again, Harry?  I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.
Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live.
Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers? Come on, move.
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
Keep moving! Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry.  I assume right about now you're wondering why I've brought you here, am I right?
Wand out, Harry.
Lumos... Ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, and their- their tears have healing powers.
Hagrid.
Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone. Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don't you? Mind?
That was fun.  May I use the loo?
Mind if I take this?  I do love knitting patterns. One destroys Voldemort.
True.  But magic, especially Dark magic...
... leaves traces. Do you?
And what of your activities outside the classroom?  Do they bring you satisfaction?
I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger.  One can't help but wonder if -- And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders.
Do you remember your first year here? When you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with Voldemort?
Do you remember what you asked me that night? The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum!
The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour
The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory. You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry; the Horcrux he never meant to make.
Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an educated guess.
I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are? On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
I'd like to have a cup of tea.
Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on. All right. It'll be all right. I understand Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice.
Is there something you wish to tell me?
Very well, then. Off you go. Oh, yes.
Not.
Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself. This pain is part of being human, Harry...
You do care. You care so much you feel like you will bleed to death because of it.
No. She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated.
He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated.
I was trying to save his life! Horace!
I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.
Dragon's blood. The Beauxbatons champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire. She will take no further part in this task.
Harry!
I want all the judges over here now. I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch  has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.
Let the feast...begin.
SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!  Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons. Then for once show them some.
But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think.
Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp. What are you doing here Miss Granger?
Barty. The bag.
Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon... I was... foolish... greedy...
For the time being?
How long? Tell me what happened!
It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are.
Severus... Not intentionally, but yes.
It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?
Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look more closely at this. Be careful. Oh, I agree with you, Professor Umbridge. You do have the power to dismiss my teachers. However...
-..-You cannot send them from this
Happily, that will not be necessary. I have found a successor Perhaps they're right.
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
It's a school.  A school of... magic. If you and your men will proceed to the Death Room, you will find several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended.
Minister, you have just seen You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds ago! It is time to come to your senses!
If you insist on trying to arrest me, I am perfectly willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be. Very good.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Quite remarkable, yes. He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.
Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that's saying something.
Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?  It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.  No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin. How did you see this? How were you positioned when you saw it?
Is Arthur seriously injured?
You were listening? Do you know who I am?
Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?
Is he in this room? Is he in this room? Naturally, naturally.
What news?
Good. Additionally, we have Professor Umbridge, who has kindly agreed to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts-—
Professor McGonagall, and...ah...
What can I do for you? I am not worried, Harry.  I am with you.
No.  Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell him what has happened...
Speak to no one else... I... I shall wait here...
