Up. Get up.  Now!
Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!
Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything. I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.
Aren’t they wonderful, darling?
Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, pumpkin? This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.
AHH!
My darling boy! How did you get in there?! How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley! It's all right. It's all right.
Awww, smile.  Vernon, just look at him. I can't believe it. In just a week you'll be off to Smeltings.
What, you? Go to Smeltings? Oh, don't be so stupid, you're going to the state school where you belong.  And this is what you're gonna be wearing when I've finished dyeing it.
It'll fit you well enough. Go get the post.  Go!
Have a lovely day at the office, dear. Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up. And we got landed with you.
We had to tell him something.
He's in there. Vernon… Not now, Bopkins. For when the Masons arrive.
…in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home.
Oh! Aaah!
Harry! Harry! Harry, open the door! Marge! How lovely to see...
Nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed. Oh, Vernon!
What happened, Duddikins?
They didn't--? I've lived in this house twenty years.  And now -- in a single night -- I'm expected to leave.
You think I don't know that?  You think I don't know what they're capable of?
You didn't just lose a mother that night in Godric's Hollow, you know.  I lost a sister. What a cruel thing to ask.
Lily! Come out of there! Now!
We're going home. Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!
How many are there?
Thirty-six?! But last year last year I had thirty-seven!! I don't care how big they are!
Make it move.
MOVE! He's boring.
Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!
Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!! Mum, mummy!
Mum, help! Help me!
Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter! AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop!
What is it? Please tell me what's happening!
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?! I-I-I'm not Harry.
Ahh!
Who'd want to be friends with you? I'll be waiting to open the door!
Dad! What's going on?
Dad, hurry up! Aaah!
Dad!
Oh, it's you. Shut up!
Ooo, tough guy. Not so tough in your bed, are you?
I heard you talking in your sleep, last night. Crying. "No, don't kill Cedric, don't kill Cedric! Dad, help me, heeelp me! He's going to kill me! Boo-hoo!" Why should I?
G-go home!
Get out of here! Don't point that thing at me!
What's happening?
I don't understand.  Isn't he coming with us? Harry.
Why?
I don't think you're a waste of space. Happy birthday, son.
Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!
Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself. Err yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year.
I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in.
Move! What happened?!
There's no such thing as magic!
Caveat Smeltona. Proudest moment of my life. Ha!
Oh, Marge is ill! Ate a funny whelk.
Yours? Who'd be writing to you? No more mail through this letterbox.
Shoo! Go on!
Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley? Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Ha! No blasted letters today. No, sir. Not one single bloody letter, not one.  No, sir, not one blasted, miserable-
Go away, ahh!
Give me that! Give me that letter! Ahh!
That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
Who's there? Ahh! I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!
He'll not be going! We swore when we took him in, we’d put a stop to this rubbish!
He'll not be going! I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
Harry Potter!
I'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird it'll have to go. Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!
I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
Which should be any minute! Ahem…Now let's go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be…? Good! And- and Dudley, you will be…?
Excellent! …And you…?
Too right, you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. And you will not mess it up! Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
Ohh, don't mind that! It's just the cat.
So when they arrive at the ninth hole… What the devil are you doing up here?
You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!
One more sound, and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy! And fix that door! …it spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this vast building, and it was this deep. And one plumber said “Look at all that water.” A-and the second plumber said, “Yes, and that's just the top of it!”
I'm so sorry! It's my nephew- he's very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him. That's why I kept him upstairs!
You're never going back to that school. You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never! Now, what the hell's he doing? Potter!
Petunia, he's escaping!
Come here! Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere!
No! No! No! No! Aaaah!
Oh… Damn. What is it?
Later perhaps, if you behave.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs! Can I tempt you, Marge?
St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
I think it's time you went to bed. Ow! Ripper! Ow! Ripper, get down, boy! Down! Ripper, stop it! Stop! I've got you, Marge! I've got you! Hold on, hold on! Get off!
Sorry!
Oh, God! Marge! Please! Marge! Come back! You bring her back! You bring her back now and you put her right! You're not allowed to do magic outside school.
They won't let you back now. You've nowhere to go.
What the heii are those? What the hell is a dementoid?
I want some answers!
By those...things? How do you know that?
Fought 'em off, eh, Dud? Gave 'em the ol' one-two?
Why is he all right then? Who are all you lot?
Come now, Dudley.  Hurry up!
Well, this is goodbye then, boy. Who?
Absolutely not.
Well, because -- he doesn't want to, do you, boy? Come on, Dudley, we're off. Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?
Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.
Ah, Mr. Potter, at last. : Room 11.
: Pea soup? Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.
F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.
An iguana s-such as this is... ... an essential in-gredient.
Oh. Y-yes, of course.  And the vampire b-bat...
TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!!  Thought you ought to know. Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh.  Ahh! Hehe....
Severus...I-I thought...
W-what do you m-mean? Yes. He does seem the type, doesn’t he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you.  And trust me, if Snape’s cloak hadn’t caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little countercurse.
I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween. Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn’t fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again.  He rarely left me alone. But he doesn’t understand. I’m never alone, never.  Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?
Come here, Potter. Now!  Tell me... what do you see?  What is it?  What do you see?
Tell the truth! What do you see?! Master, you are not strong enough.
Ahh! Ahh!  What is this magic? It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.  This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy.  Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well, soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.
Up!
Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse. No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find.  How 'bout up on the roof?  What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?
Is that so?  Have it your way, then!
Wingardium Levio-saaa. No!
Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said..."the four of us."
The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are......werewolves! Okay. Then I get Fang!
You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.
Scared, Potter?!  Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared. HELP!!!!!
I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.
Oh look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend. See you at school.
That's right. And that's not all that new this year.
You see Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best. No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood!
Ha, ha!
Ha, ha… 'Enemies of the heir beware!' You'll be next, Mudbloods!
All right there, Scarhead?
Training for the ballet, Potter? You'll never catch me, Potter!
Uhh, uhhh…
Scared, Potter? Everte statium!
Serpensortia!
Crabbe, Goyle! Where have you two been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Why are you wearing glasses? Reading?
I didn't know you could read. And what are you doing down here, Weasley?
Well, sit down. You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. What's wrong with you, Crabbe? You know, I'm surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place.
What? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?
Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin! You know I don't Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this: It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it-- only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So, it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me, I hope it's Granger. What's the matter with you two? You're acting very…odd.
Hey! Where are you going?
Potter. Is it true you fainted? I mean, you actually fainted? Exactly how do we do that?
Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
Oh, yeah. Terribly funny. Really Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes. D-Dementor! Dementor!
Oh, please.
Yes you're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute! It's killed me! It's killed me!
Oh You're gonna regret this.
You and your bloody chicken! It comes and it goes. Still, I consider myself lucky. Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm. I couldn't do homework for weeks.
This class is ridiculous.
Well, well. Look who's here. You two shopping for your new dream home? Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee? Don't your family sleep in uh... one room? Uh, Not very friendly. Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
How dare you talk to me! You filthy little mudblood! Who is that? Don't stand there! Do something!
Get out of the way! Move! Now I'll tell you. Father said... I can keep the hippogriff's head. I think I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room. This is going to be rich. Look who's here. Come to see the show?
Not a word to anyone, understood?
Not a word to anyone, understood? I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words. Father and I are in the minister's box, by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself.
Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last
My father will hear about this! I should thank you, Weasley. You're definitely our best player!
Bet you loved that, Potter! Saved Weasley's neck, didn't you?
I've never seen a worse Keeper! Maybe we should add some more verses to our little song. About his filthy mother! And his pathetic loser of a father too!
But then, you like the Weasleys, don't you? How can you stand the stink? I guess it reminds you of your own dear mother!
God, I can't wait until all you Weasleys have been expelled. Your stench has been fouling this castle for too long. That's for speaking to me. You know, you Weasleys are just as bad as Mudbloods!
You know, Weasley, it's really too bad Potter saved you from the Chamber of Secrets.
What just happened?  Blaise? Hogwarts.  What a pathetic excuse for a school.  I think I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower if I thought I had to continue on for another two years.
Let's just say I don't think you'll be seeing me wasting my time in Charms Class next year.
Amused, Blaise?  We'll see just who's laughing in the end. You two go on.  I want to check something.
Didn't mummy ever tell you it's bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus!
Oh, right, she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin. Enjoy the ride back to London.
It's a not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick.
Is my father's.  He's not dead. Nice face, Potter.
Take your hands off me,  you filthy squib!
Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy? Certainly... Professor.
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't.  What's it to you?
I don't need protection.  I was chosen for this!  Out of all others.  Me!  And I won't fail him. No!  I was chosen.  This is my moment!
Cruci--
Don't touch me!  Don't you dare touch me! Who else is here?  I heard you talking.
How do you know what I am?  I've done things that would shock you.
He trusts me!  I was chosen! Expelliarumus!
The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement.
I've been mending it. In Borgin & Burkes.  They form --
I don't want your help!  Don't you see!  I have to do it!  I have to! I've got to kill you or he'll kill me.
I can't be sure. What's wrong with his face?
Take my hand.
Well, well, what brings you here, Potter? Harry looks slowly over his shoulder. Draco -- Blaise and Goyle at his side -- steps INTO VIEW, his face bisected by light. He holds a wand on Harry. I virtually lived here last year. Remember?
Easy.
Give me my wand. Potter! Harry turns. Draco's hand whips forward and -- to Harry's shock -- tosses him his wand. Ron GRINS. Anyone here, my sweet?  Come on.
Who's there?!  I know you're in there. You can't hide.  Who is it? Show yourself!
Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed. A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming.  You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest.  A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?
Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.
There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that.  Nighty-night. Well, take a good look lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. Hm. Oh, dear, we are in trouble.
What's going on 'ere? Go on, make way, make way. Potter-- What are you…Mrs. Norris? You've…murdered my cat.
I'll kill ya… I'll kill ya! Ask him. It's him who's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall.
Rubbish!
My cat has been Petrified. I wanna see some punishment! Caught in the act! I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words.
Those with permission, follow me. Those without, stay put.
There's no need for ghosts, professor. The Fat Lady's there. I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery, sir. But there's nothing there.
Last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now!
Professor! It's those Weasley twins! They've set something off in the Astronomy Tower! I've got you now!
And what exactly would you be wanting with a walking stick?
Professor Slughorn, sir!  I've just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.  He claims to have been invited to your party. Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!
Oh. Sorry, mum.
Right away. Night-tee night. Use the boy.
He lies.
Let me speak to him. I have strength enough for this.
Harry Potter, we meet again.
Yes. You see what I’ve become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can, something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket. Stop him.  Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!
Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back.  All I ask for is something in return.  That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone!
Kill him! Fool! Get the stone!
NO! The boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it WILL be done exactly as I say.
Good. First, gather our old comrades. Send them a sign. Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door.
Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
Let me see it again. Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry! At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can give our guest a proper greeting!
Kill the spare.
Do it, now! My wand Wormtail.
Hold out your arm.
The other arm Wormtail. Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me.
Not even you, Lucius.
There were signs my friend, and more than whispers. Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail.
Oh, such a handsome boy.
Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? It was love. You see when dear sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch you. It was old magic, something I should have forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed, I can touch you now! Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow!
That's better. And now...
Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up. Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes.
Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's mine!
No! Bow to death, Harry...
Can you reach it? Can you take it for me, Black?
Oh, you will die. Eventually. But there are hours, even days of pain awaiting you before then. I'm going to enjoy this, Black. I have you, and soon I shall have the weapon. And then not even your pathetic Order can stand in my way! Voldemort laughs, a horrible spine-chilling laugh.
So, you smashed my prophesy...
I grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans, Harry Potter! Avada Kadavra!
It is you who made that mistake, Dumbledore!
Avada Kedavra! You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?
There is nothing worse than death!
Severus.  I was beginning to worry you'd lost your way.  Come.  I've saved you a seat. You know our hosts, of course, Severus.  Narcissa in particular has been most hospitable.  Lucius, on the other hand, is, I fear, burdened by my presence.  Are you, Lucius?
Are you burdened?
You bring news I trust, Severus? And this information comes --
Pius, what say you?
Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.  Where will he be taken?  The boy? Wormtail!  Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?
As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.  But I face an unfortunate complication.  It has recently come to my attention that my wand and Potter's share the same core. They are, in some ways, twins.  We can wound but not fatally harm one another.  Which means, if I am to kill him... I will have to do it with another's wand.
Come now.  Surely one of you would like the honor?  What about... you, Lucius? I require your wand.
Do I detect elm?
And the core? My wand?  You can't possibly think I would give you my wand.
For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Her specialty was Muggle studies. It is Miss Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us.
She would, given her way, have us mate with them.  To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination but something to be encouraged.  I, of course, take a contrary view.  But we're all civilized here.  All adults.  We can agree to disagree. Avada Kedavra!
Nagini... Dinner.
Avada... Then explain this!
Perhaps our friend's loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail.
I hope so, Ollivander, for your sake.  I won't be so forgiving next time... You wouldn't be lying to me, would you, Gregorovitch?  Because, I must tell you... that will only make it worse for you...
Who was he?  The thief?
I believe you... I have seen your heart and it is mine...
If not you, then who?
Tell me, Grindelwald.  Tell me where to find it!  Tell me who possesses it!  The name, Grindelwald!  The name! The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. We must find out just how much he knows. We must return to our hiding places and see if the others are safe.
I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think this wise. But this is foily.
I wish you no harm. TI have great respect for the students of Hogwarts. I was once one myself after all. I ask for but one thing and if granted no magical blood shail be spiit... Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shail leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded.
They never learn. Such a pity.
Begin. Nagini. Come.
Stop looking at her. She smells your fear. It agitates her. Be grateful she's just eaten.
I do not need to seek the boy! Before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand! How do you live with yourself, Lucius?  Go. Find Severus. Tell him I need to see him immediately.
Why doesn't it work for me?
No! I am extraordinary! But the wand resists me! Does it?
The wand. Does it truly answer to me?
You're a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know. Where, Severus? Where does its loyalty lie?
The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am
The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. Ollivander was quite explicit about that. You killed Dumbledore, Severus. While you live, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine. You have been a good and faithful servant, Severus.
But only I can live forever...
Kill. Nagini! Come!
You have fought valiantly... but in vain. I do not wish this. Every drop of magical bliood
I therefore command my forces to retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. I thought he would come. I was, it seems... mistaken.
Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. Come to die. Nagini HISSES behind her protective guard of Death Eaters. Harry's gaze shifts to her when Voldemort raises
I do not require assistance. Behold, Nagini. Our work is done.
Stupid girl. You cry for that?
While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only. While you battled courageously, until you could no longer will yourself to stand, he had long since fallen to his knees. While you cursed me until your voices grew ragged, he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek as a child's. So do not cry for that. He's not worthy of your tears. And do not despair of his betrayal. You were never in his heart. Not for one single solitary beat.
Did you not hear me! Harry Potter is dead! From this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences. HARRY POTTER Is
Now is the time to declare yourself. Well done, Draco. Who will be next? Hm? Come now, don't be shy.
Well, I must say, I'd hoped for better. Is this truly the best Hogwarts has to offer?
Who might you be, young man? Well, welcome, Neville. I'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks.
Now, now, Bellatrix. Let's not underestimate our young friend. By stepping forward, he lives to see another day...
Very well, Neville. I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say. Nagini! With me!
Leave her!
I said LEAVE HER! Nagini
Die! Die
Why do you live! It belongs to me! I killed Snape! It can't be- Harry Potter?
Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front page! Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me,… which, incidentally is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list, he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving… with my entire collected works, free of charge. Now, ladies?
Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher… me! Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-times winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award- but I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him. Huh, huh, huh… hee, hee… Now- be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind. You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. I must ask you not to scream. It might… provoke them! Freshly caught Cornish pixies!
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnigan, but pixies can be devilish tricky little blighters. Let's see what you make of them, ha! Come on now- round them up, round them up, they're only pixies!
Peskipiksi pesternomi! I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage!
Harry, Harry, Harry… Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that. Sorry?
Voice?
What are you talking about, Harry? I think we're getting a bit a- drowsy. And, Great Scott- no wonder! Look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours! Spooky how the time flies when one's having fun. Heh, heh. Ah, thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there. I know exactly the counter curse that could have spared her.
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail.
Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straight away. Oh, poor boy doesn't know what he's saying. Now, this… won't hurt a bit. Brackium emendo!
Ah, yes, well, ha, that can sometimes happen, um, butuh, the point is, uh,…
…you can no longer feel any pain, and, heh- very clearly, the bones are not broken. Much more flexible, though.
Gather 'round, gather 'round! Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves, as I myself have done on countless occasions- for full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry- you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, never fear. One, two, three.
Whoaah! An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind me saying, it was pretty obvious- ah- what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy.
An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Ah… Let's have a volunteer pair! Um, Potter, Weasley, how about you?
Good luck, Potter. Wands at the ready.
On the count of three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent- only to disarm. We don't want any accidents here. One, two--
I said disarm only! Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte ascendare!
So sorry- dozed off- what have I missed?
My m-moment? Very well- ah- I'll just be in my office getting, umgetting ready.
Uh, ah- well, yes- um, urgent call- unavoidable- got to go.
Well, um- as to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I. Well- I must say- when I took the job there was nothing in the job description about a…
Books can be misleading!
My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things! Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. And I'd never have sold another book. In fact, ah…I'm ah…going to have to do the same to you.
Excellent, Harry. Haa! Good work! Well then, I'll just be, ah… There's no need for me to stay.
Now, boys what good will it do? Um…but…obviously, yes. Sure you don't want to test it first? No! Aaaah! It's really quite filthy down here.
It looks like a… snake.
The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So, you first, Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. Obliviate! Uhh… Hello. Who are you?
Really? And uh, who- who am I?
It's an odd sort of place this, isn't it? Do you live here? Really? Well?
Amazing! This is just like magic! Now, now Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter… Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is legend, as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.
Hmm. You must be very brave, to mention his name…or very foolish.
And you must be… Miss Granger. Yes, Draco's told me all about you, and your parents. Muggles, aren't they? Let me see…red hair… vacant expressions… tatty second hand book. You must be the Weasleys. Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they're paying you overtime, but judging by the state of this, I'd say not. What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it.
Clearly. Associating with Muggles… and I thought your family could sink no lower. I'll see you at work. Already here, Fudge? Good…
Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your-- you call this a house? Huh! No. I simply called at the school, and was told the headmaster was here.
The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. You'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school. You think so?
Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!
I'll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, it's true-- you have returned! Ridiculous!
How dare you?!
My sole concern has always been, and will always be, the welfare of this school and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume? And? Who was it?
Ah!
I see. Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.
Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. We're leaving.
Mine? I don't know what you're talking about. You do, do you? Why don't you prove it? Come, Dobby. Dobby!
Dobby?
What? I didn't give. You've lost me my servant!
Advada.
Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words, Potter, one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end! Well put it this way, if it rains... you'll be the first to know
Don't boast Draco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy yourself won't you. While you can.
My lord. Had I detected any sign or even a whisper of your whereabouts. I assure you I never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence, that was my true mask.
Well, well, if it isn't Patronus Potter.
Come now, Potter, I really don't think that private matters between the Minister and myself are any concern of yours. Shall we continue this in your
I warned you before that one day you would come to a sticky end, Potter.
We don't have him, if that's what you mean. Harry is stunned. The Dark Lord knows your weakness for heroics, Potter. All it took was a little nudge to get you here.
Now give me that prophesy.
That prophesy. Now hand it over or we'll have to use wands on you. Very brave of you, Potter. Or are you foolish?
Really, Potter. You expect to defeat all of us with your little school friends? Now hand it over, and they won't have to die here.
No! If the prophesy is smashed-- You dare to speak the Dark Lord's name?
Control yourself, Bellatrix!
You mean Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden here? So that's what took you so long. We wondered.
Only a person for whom the prophesy was made can remove it from its self, Potter, and the Dark Lord certainly couldn't get it himself.
Stop them! Your race is run, Potter. Hand it over.
You are not in a position to negotiate.
Potter! We may have lost the prophesy, but I can still deliver you to the Dark Lord!
Stupify!
My lord? Yes, my lord.
Dragon -- dragon heartstring.
No, my lord. Draco. Look closely, son. If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord... ...everything would be forgiven. All would be as it was, you understand?
You dare to talk to me like that in my own house?
Forgive me, my Lord, but wouldn't it be more prudent to call off this battle and seek the boy yourself? Of c-course, my Lord.
Draco...
Draco, don't be stupid -- Come, come, come to me. Come to me!
Blood. I smell blood. Let me rip you. Let me kill you. Kill! Kill!
It's time. Kill. Kill… Time to kill!
Blood…I want blood…They all must die. Kill… Kill… Kill! Time to kill. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
It's good right? Ah… Cool!
Ummm…um. What?
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
Malfoy, are you okay? Let's go. Quick. Run. Ummm…um.
C'mon, Draco. Don't be a prat.
Avada Kedavra! Hello Harry Potter, my name is Tom Riddle.
Yes.
No. But I can show you. Let me take you back fifty years ago… Professor Dumbledore.
Yes, Professor. I- I suppose I- I had to see for myself if the rumors were true.
About the school, as well? I don't have a home to go to. They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they Professor? Sir- if it all stopped- if the person responsible was caught--
No, sir. Nothing.
Good night, sir. Evening, Hagrid. I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone, but--
The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. Now, stand aside. Stand aside, Hagrid!
Cistem aperio! Arania exumai!
I can't let you go. They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled. She won't wake.
She's still alive, but only just.
A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years. It won't come until it's called.
You won't be needing it.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets. It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls.
Because I told her to. You'll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girl's bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet.
I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust. It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target… has been you. How is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed? Voldemort is my past, present, and future.
Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.
Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me! So, this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird and an old hat. Shearhas- Samnathas- Sélithaeine.
Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. Sethae- He- This. Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. It only obeys me!
No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you! Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes Ginny will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return- very… much… alive!
Remarkable isn't it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do… especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. What are you doing? Stop! No! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!
Don't. You're the doctor, aren't you?
I don't believe you.  I hear Mrs. Cole talking, her and the rest of the staff.  They want me looked at.  They think I'm different.
I'm not mad. Yes.
I can make things move -- without touching them.  I can make animals do what I want without training them.  I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.  I can make them hurt... if I want.
Who are you? Prove it.
I like having things that belonged to other people.  It makes me feel ... close to them.
I can speak to snakes too. They find me.  Whisper things.  Is that normal.  For someone like me?
Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?
Intuition. I know a secret shortcut or two.
Yes, sir.  I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.  The other professors, well, they're not like you.  They might... misunderstand.
I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic, and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me... Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?
Intuition.
I know a secret shortcut or two. Yes, sir.  I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.  The other Professors, well, they're not like you.  They might... misunderstand.
I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me.  It's called, as I understand it... a Horcrux.
Horcrux.  I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it. Yes, sir.  Which is why I came to you.  I mean no disrespect to the rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you.
Yes, I thought it might be something like that.  But I don't understand how that works, sir.
Protected? How does one split his soul, sir?
Murder.
Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once?  For instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number -- Of course, sir.  And I promise I'll not speak of our conversation.  It'll be our little secret... Oh, you're still here, are you?
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way. Damn good of my brother to keep you. He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep. Is that my Dudders? Is that my little neffy-pooh? Give us a kiss! Come on! Up, up!
Finish that off for Mommy. Good boy, Rippy-pooh. Just a small one. Excellent nosh, Petunia. A bit more. Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs. Just a bit more. That's a boy! Mm! You wanna try a little drop of brandy? A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh? What are you smirking at? Where did you send the boy, Vernon?
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby... wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it. You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out. It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out. What is it the boy's father did, Petunia? And a drunk too, no doubt?
What did you say?
Oh, don't worry Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip. Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up. Actually, it's nothing to do with the father. It's all to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the pup.
Mm. Right! Let me tell you... y-y-- Vernon! Vernon! Vernon, do something!
Don't you dare! Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
Relax, boys.  The lights went out is all.  Come, Draco.  We'll be at Hogwarts before you know it.
What's that supposed to mean? But he's there! Potter's there! Someone grab him!
You let us out of here, you filthy squib! Remus? Sirius. My old friends! Harry! Look at you! You look so much like your father! Like James! We were the best of friends...
I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses! Ask yourself, Sirius! What would you have done? What would you have done?
Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed! Your dad... Your dad would have spared me! He would show me mercy! Bless you, boy! Bless you!
Turn me into a maggot! Turn me into a flobberworm! Anything but the dementors! Ron! Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you? I was your rat! Sweet girl! Clever girl! Surely you won't let them...
Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only meant... perhaps if we were to do it without the boy.. Bones of the father, unwillingly given.
Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed.
Blood of the enemy forcibly taken. The dark lord shall rise again.
Master. Thank you master.
I returned. Thank you master, thank you.
Yes, m-my lord.  Right away, my lord.
Shut up. Get back. You, goblin, come with me. Ow. I will not disappoint you my lord.
Get your hands off me you pathetic little men. Hello father.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours. You know what this means don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.
I'll be welcomed back like a hero. Albus!
You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought Mad-Eye.
I do sir. I have names sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier.
Dead?
I didn't know. No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy.
Ya ya, the same. He passed information to you know who from inside the ministry itself.
NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape, Severus Snape. It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the dark lord.
Oh no no no no no. I heard about one more.
The name... I know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and by means of the cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer Frank Longbottom and...
Barty Crouch! ... Junior.
It's a sign Severus, you know what it means as well as I. Filth! Scum! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers?!
Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh! Excuse me, Dumbledore, but did you just accused the Ministry of Magic of ordering an attack on this boy?
Hem, hem, Headmaster, if I could address the school?
Thank you, Headmaster. Now, how are we all doing tonight? I thought I would just say a few words. I am here at the Ministry of Magic's bequest, under Educational Decree twenty-two, which states that if the Headmaster of Hogwarts is unable to fill any teaching post the Ministry shall select one for the position. Hmm, let's see, five points from Gryffindor for coming in late.
Now, as I was saying before Mr. Potter interrupted with his antics, your Defense Against the Dark Arts education has been rather fragmented and disjointed in your past classes, hasn't it?
I will be following a pre-approved Ministry-prepared, theory-centered Defense lesson plan. Copy this down.
Yes?
Well, they should be perfectly self- evident. Miss Granger, this class has been approved by Ministry experts. Are you a Ministry Expert?
Then you have no business challenging those who are. We will be learning about spells in a safe, risk-free environment-
Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter. Let me set the record straight. Some of you have been told that a certain dead wizard has returned. This is a lie.
Mr. Potter, you have just landed yourself in detention!
The boy's death was a tragic accident. Mr Potter, you have earned yourself a week's worth of detentions!
That goes to Professor McGonagall, dear.
Ah, Potter. Sit down. You're going to be doing lines, tonight, Mr. Potter, and you'll be using this quill.
You will write "I will not tell lies" until I tell you to stop. Understand?
Oh...you won't need ink. Problem, Potter?
That's enough for this evening. Same time, tomorrow, and we'll see if we can get the message to sink in a bit deeper.
That's enough for tonight, Potter. Let's see that hand. And how long have you been at this post?
I understand you are the descendent of the famous Seer Cassandra Trelawney?
And you are the first since Cassandra to have the Second Sight? Of course.
Now, if you would kindly make a prediction for me?
The Inner Eye does not See upon command! Well, if that's the best you can do, Professor, I will be going.
I thought you might need some additional authority in dealing with these two.
I hardly think that's an adequate punishment for this. Educational Decree Twenty-Five. It gives me, as High Inquisitor, the power to give punishments and privileges, and to alter those given out to students by other members of the staff.
So, I think a life-long ban from playing quidditch should do the trick for both of these. Oh, and this one's twin as well. He was going to attack Malfoy as well.
Yes, indeed, Mr. Potter. Ah, I'll take your brooms as well.
Well, have a wonderful day.
I can do whatever I wish! Not anymore.
Now remove yourself from this castle!
I have the authority, Headmaster! And what of her quarters when I appoint a new teacher.
Since I had received information some time ago that Potter and a number of other students had met in the Hog's Head to start an illegal group--
I'm sorry? But two days later, Educational Decree Twenty-Four was introduced.
I have a witness right here!
Let's ask her, shall we? You can shake your head for an
What do you mean by shaking your head, girl?
But what about Potter? He was the Why are you shaking your head, girl?
My apologies, Headmaster. I forgot myself.
"By Order of the Ministry of Magic: Dolores Jane Umbridge will replace Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry." My first act as your new Headmistress is to form an Inquisitional Squad, lead by Draco Malfoy. They will report directly to me about the goings on in the halls of this school.
Furthermore, our good caretaker, Mr. Filch has requested we reinstate the 'old punishments.' I have decided that there is no reason we shouldn't.
Ready to try out the old punishments again? So, turning a hallway into a swamp is funny, is it?
Well, now you're going to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.
Well, now you're going to get your You think you could simply walk into my office without me knowing about it? Foolish boy!
Accio wand!
Who were you trying to contact? Draco, would you fetch Professor Snape, please?
Very well, Potter. I have been patient enough with you.
I have just caught Potter trying to communicate with someone in my fire. I need some Veritaserum. Truth syrum. We've played nicely, Potter. You
You could have saved me a lot of trouble if those Dementors I sent to your house had finished you off!
Of course I did! Someone had to act! Well, well.
Shut up, Potter! Now talk, you silly girl! Who were you talking to?
Tell him? You and Mr. Potter will take me to it.
Much further, is it?
Your forest? This forest belongs to the Ministry of Magic! Stay back, you beasts!
You cannot attack me! Any attack on a wizard by a half-breed--
Come no closer! Incarcerus!
Ingrates! Animals! Filthy half- bloods!
Ah, Mafalda!  Travers sent you, did he?  Good.  We'll go straight down. Runcorn.
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred?  Wife to Reginald? A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole.  Is this that wand?
Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand.
No, no, I don't think so, Mrs. Cattermole.  Wands only choose witches.  And you are not a witch. What the devil are you doing, Albert? I haven't escaped from Azkaban for this!
Take the youngest girl. We'll see how committed Potter is as we torture her.
Surely you jest, Potter? Silence! How dare you utter that name from your half—-blood mouth!
Check under the desks.
Avada-— There they are!
Neville? Neville Longbottom?
My dear boy, I paid your parents a visit a long time ago. We had such a time! So, Potter. Give us the Prophesy or I'll see how long it takes to crack Longbottom like his parents.
Crucio!
You can't stop me, Potter! Come out, come out, Potter...
Well, well, have you come to avenge your dear Godfather?
Crucio! Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, Potter? You have to mean it, you have to want to cause the pain in your very soul...
Give me the prophesy!
You lie! Forgive me, Master! I tried, I--
Narcissa!
Cissy! You mustn't do this.  He can't be trusted. The Dark Lord is mistaken.
Or so I believe.
He lives in this Muggle dunghill? You must be joking.
You? The Dark Lord told you?
You should feel honored, Cissy. As should Draco -- Swear to it.
Make the Unbreakable Vow. You see.  It's just empty words. Oh he'll try.  He'll give it his best effort.  But when it matters most he'll slither back into his hole.  Bloody coward...
Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Draco Malfoy as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes. And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?
And should it prove necessary, if it seems Draco will fail... will you yourself carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?
Well now, look what we have here. Dumbledore.  Wandless and alone. Cornered in his own castle.  Well done, Draco.
Love to, Albus.  But I'm afraid we're on a bit of a tight schedule.
He doesn't have the stomach.  Like his father.  Let me finish him. In my own way. Well, look who's here.  Hogwarts own Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Come to see the slaughter?
Boo.
Draco!  Draco! They'll kill you if you stay. My lord, if I might, I'd like to volunteer myself for this task. I'd like to kill the boy.
Show me. Get Draco. Well?
Lucius. Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over. Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco, and we call him, he'll kill us all. We need to be absolutely sure. Yes, what is wrong with his face?
Or ran into a Stinging Jinx. Was it you, dearie? Give me her wand. We'll see what her last spell was. Ah. Got you. What is that? Where'd you get that from?
Cissy, put the boys in the cellar. I want to have a little conversation with this one, girl-to-girl. That sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it? What else did you and your friends take from my vault?!
I don't believe it.
Shut up! I'm only going to ask you once more, goblin. Think very, very carefully before you answer.
You don't know? Why weren't you doing your job? Who got into my vault? Who stole it? Who stole it? Well?
Liar! Consider yourself lucky, goblin. The same won't be said for this one. Stop! Drop your wands. I said, drop them! Pick them up, Draco, now. Well, well, well, look what we have here. It's Harry Potter. He's all bright and shiny and new again, just in time for the Dark Lord. Call him. Call him.
Stupid elf. You could've killed me.
How dare you take a witch's wand? How dare you defy your masters? Well, how do I look?
Oh dear, I missed a spot, didn't I? Hold still...
I wish to enter my vault. I don't like to be kept waiting.
He's with me.
And why should I do that? No, I most certainly do not understand --
My lord, let me help you --
The boy. Is he dead? Someone has to do the washing.
Come on, granny, give us your best.
Be thankful we only took one. Besides... The Dark Lord trusts him.
Well, who can one trust these days?
I've nowhere else to turn, Severus. I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself has forbidden me to speak of this --
I... I don't doubt you, Severus.
He's just a boy! Do you mean it, Severus?
Oh, Severus, please, if you would... I would be forever in your debt.
My lord is always welcome here. Is he alive? Draco?
Come, Draco. Don't know.
Have you ever taken it, sir? Don't you smell clean.
Do it.
Hear that, ugly?  The list says you're lying.  How come you don't want us to know who you are?  Hm? I have heard differently, my lord. Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that the Potter boy will not be moved until the thirtieth of this month, the night before he turns seventeen.
Cattlemole!
It's still raining in my office. Two days now. You do realize I'm on my way downstairs, don't you, Cattermole?
To interrogate your wife!  If my wife's blood status were in doubt and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I think I'd make it a priority.  You've got one hour.
Seal the exits!  Now! No sign of him, my Lord.
Quiet! What's that?  That... smell?
Hello, beautiful.
Your boyfriend'll get worse than that if he doesn't behave, lovely. What happened to you, ugly?
What's your name?
Check the list.  And you, ginger? Like 'ell you are.  We know skinny Stan.  Try again.
Weasley, eh?  Wouldn't be related to that blood traitor Arthur Weasley, would you?
Worth ten times you if I can find him.  Wasn't you that tipped him off, was it? How 'bout you, lovely?  What do they call you...?
You smell like vanilla, Penelope. I think you're going to be my favorite.
Change of plans, boys.  We won't be taking this lot to the Ministry. Now, we won't be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy. Ah, Tom, I thought you would come one day.  But surely you must know I no longer have what you seek...
You're so innocent, Tom.  Like a schoolboy.  There's so much you don't understand...
Can't you guess, Tom?  It lies with him, of course.  Buried within the earth.  It is he who possesses it, even in death.  Your old friend and mine... Dumbledore. Put a smile on, Miss Reynolds. Wouldn't want me to have to pay a visit to Daddy again, would you?
